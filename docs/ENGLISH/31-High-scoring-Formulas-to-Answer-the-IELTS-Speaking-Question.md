How to Use 31 High-scoring Formulas to Answer the IEL TS Speaking Questions 

## Structure of the Book 

This book can be used [[eithedor]] self-study or as in-class training material. 31 High-scoring Formulas to Answer the IELTS Speaking Questions consists of 3 parts corresponding to the IELTS Speaking test components. Part 1: 20 high-scoring formulas for IELTS Speaking Test Part One Part 2: 4 high-scoring formulas for IELTS Speaking Test Part Two Part 3: 7 high-scoring formulas for IELTS Speaking Test Part Three , Each formula consists of 2 sections: Answer order and Language steps. Answer order shows you "what to say", which indicates the logic of an answer needed for a speaking test question type; and Language steps show you "how to say it", which includes detailed vocabulary and grammar you need to communicate your ideas. 

## Learning Strategies 

It is recommended that you follow the order of content presented in this book, starting with the basic and easier content first to set a firm base for your speaking skill. To maximise your learning results, consider these following steps: 

1. Clearly understand the purposes and content of each chapter. After every chapter, check to     see whether you have achieved what is intended for that chapter. 

2. Master both Answer order and Language steps. Through Answer order, learn how to think     logically like natives to plan your answers; through Language steps, learn the vocabulary and     grammar needed for your answers. 

3. Acquire new vocabulary by doing the vocabulary exercises and using these words into prac-     tical conversation. 

4. Read the model answers and note down how important words and structures are used in     context. 

5. Study the explanation of model examples and practise with extensive exercises for more     accurate expressions and richer answers. 

6. Work through the material with your friends, if possible. You all can ask and answer in turn     to practise the high-scoring formulas.

Native speaker words 

Let's learn some native speaker words which are useful for answering this type of question. These words can also help you understand the model answers on the next page more thoroughly.

 Part One 

Model answers 

Read the model answers from the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David. 

Language step I Prefer 

Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the verb prefer. 

 Alice I prefer cycling to travelling by bus... ] David Generally, I prefer chatting online ... 

Obviously, the first thing you need to tell the examiner for this type of question is whether you prefer X or Y. Prefer can be followed by either verb-ing or to verb. 

Notice in the examples below that prefer + verb-ing can be followed by either to or rather than, but prefer + to verb can only be followed by rather than. 

prefer + verb-ing + to / rather than + verb-ing I prefer cycling to t:akjng the bus. I prefer eating to cookjng. I prefer bal{jn.g cakes at home rather than buying them in shops. I prefer reading a newspaper rather than watching TV. 

prefer + to verb + rather than + verb I prefer to cycle rather than tak§ the bus. I prefer to eat rather than cool?, I pref er to cakes at home rather than bLtV them in shops. I prefer to read a newspaper rather than watch TV. Both these forms are correct, and mean exactly the same. 

---

dJ Exercise 1.1: Error Correction 

 Some of the sentences below are incorrect, some are correct. Identify the incorrect sentences and write the correct sentences in the spaces provided. 

1. I prefer to go to the cinema to watch DVDs at home. 

2. My sister prefers writing letters to write emails. 

3. I prefer to talk with friends on the phone rather than using emails. 

4. I much prefer to live in a town rather than a big city. 

5. My mother prefers shopping at the market more than in supermarkets. 

6. My friends generally prefer to send text messages to talking on the phone. 

 Language step 2 Comparatives Let's look again at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the comparatives. 

 Alice ... Cycling is so much more convenient than taking the bus if you're not travelling too far. Actually, it's often faster to go by bike because you don't get stuck in traffic jams! Cycling is also better for my health than all other means of transport, including buses. David .. .I nearly always find that chatting online can be more sociable as you can speak to more than one person at the same time. Also, chatting online is often much more fun because you can send smileys, photos and even videos! 

 Mter you have told the examiner whether you prefer X or Y, you should compare them, so it's very important to use comparatives correctly. To form the comparative of an adjective, you should: add -er if the adjective is one syllable long. add -ier if the adjective has two syllables and ends in -yo add more before the adjective ifit has two or more syllables. 

---

 Part One 

 Look at the table below to see how these rules work. 

 large fast slow 

 larger fasteI! slower 

 heavy pretty ugly 

 heavier 

. prettier     uglier 

 comfortable more comfortable 'fashionable more fashionable useful more useful 

 When you compare X and Y, you should use one of the following comparative structures: X + be + comparative + than + Y Watching TV is more interesting than listening to the radio. Cars are prettier than buses. X + be + not as + adjective + as + Y Listening to the radio is not as interesting as watching TV. Buses are not as pretty as cars.

Extra language point Discourse Markers 

Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use discourse markers in their answers. 

 Alice ... Cycling is so much more convenient than taking the bus if you're not travelling too far. Actually, it's often faster to go by bike because ... David .. .I nearly always find that chatting online can be more sociable as you can speak to more than one person at the same time. Also, chatting online is often much more fun because ... 

One reason why Alice's and David's answers are so good is that both candidates put extra little words (called discourse markers) into their answers in a very native way. 

Try to use the following words and expressions more often when you speak English, as they will help make you sound more like a native speaker: 

actually lin fact 

Actually and in fact are very often used by native speakers to introduce something that may be surprising or that slightly changes what was being said before. It is actually a lot cheaper to go to that supermarket. 111 fact, public buses are a lot more environmentally friendly than many people think.

 Part One 

 needless to say Needless to say is another way of saying obviously or everybody knows that." without sounding rude or arrogant. I like eating lots of cakes, but needless to say, that will make me fat. He's done very badly in his exams, so needless to say, he won't get into university this year. 

 also/in addition Also and in addition are used to add extra or further information. I'm a very sociable person. I prefer team sports such as basketball and football and in addition, I like going to English club with my friends. I prefer cycling rather than driving a car because it helps me keep fit; in addition, it's better for the environment and it's also cheaper! 

 besides Besides at the beginning of a phrase means as well as, whereas at the beginning of a clause it means anyway. Besides watching TV and talking to my friends, I can relax while travelling on the subway. I like riding a bike as it's a very convenient way to travel. Besides, it's cheap and I can't afford a car.

My father's recently become keen, on photography, so he's bought an expensive digital camera and spends a lot of time taking photos of everything. I think the Harry Potter novels are fantastic. I often buy those small magazines with short stories in them and read them on the subway on my way to work. Although I come from England, I only eat spicy food every so often.

 In the second sentence, it refers back to studying English. Use it when you are sure that both you and the person you are speaking to are talking about the same thing. Remember, if what you were talking about before was plural, you must say they instead of it. For example: I like watching football matches -they are so exciting.

I'm involved in a reading group at my university and every so often we get together and discuss the latest books we've read over dinner it's so stimu1ating to talk and hear different views about the books we've all read. 

 To explain why you like doing something, you should use adjectives of positive feeling. It is often difficult for non-native speakers to use them correctly, and candidates frequently lose marks in the IELTS test because of this type of mistake. Adjectives of positive feeling come from stative verbs such as satisfy, bore and excite. There are two ways to turn this type of verb into adjectives of positive feeling. Use be + verb-ed when talking about the person who is experiencing the emotion: He is bored when he has nothing to do. She isfascinated by music. They are interested in playing football. I am satisfied with my lessons. The boy is excited when I give him food. Use be + verb-ing when talking about the thing that is causing the emotion: Football is boring. Music isfascinating. Studying English is interesting. Seeing a concert is exciting. Eating a big dinner is satisfying.

 Language step 3 Very Much Let's take a look at how the IELTS candidate David uses very much. 

 David .. .1 don't like my line manager or many of my colleagues very -they're all so boring ... 

 Many students make the terrible mistake of saying the following types of sentences in the IELTS test: I very playing tennis. (X ) I don't liI?g Vel) much going shopping. ( X ) 

---

 Part One 

 This is very bad English and does not sound like a native. 

 Look at the following correct native speaker sentences and see if you can see the correct word order patterns: I like playing tennis very much. I don't like going shopping very much. 

 There are three rules you must remember: You cannot use very before a verb. You cannot use very much before a verb. You can use very much after the activity. Examples: I like reading romantic novels very much. I really like reading romantic novels. I don't like going climbing in the mountains very much. I really don't like going climbing in the mountains. If you want to sound like a native, we advise you to only use very much with short sentences. 

rdJ Exercise 4.3: Error Correction 

 Some of the sentences below are incorrect, some are correct. Identify the incorrect sentences and write the correct sentences in the spaces provided. 

1. I very enjoy studying English.

Read the model answers from the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David. 

Language step I Adverbs of Frequency 

Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use adverbs of frequency. 

 Alice I used to go out to dinner with my friends all the time, but I'm in my last year of university now and I'm really busy .•. David To be honest, I' m reading books; I'm a complete bookworm! I usually rea:d novels, but sometimes (mix it up slightly and read books about history @r nature ...

8. A I B watch TV C. (all the time) 

9. A he B listens to the radio C. (seldom) 

 Language step 2 Adverbs of Infrequency Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use certain adverbs to describe things they rarely do. 

 Alice .. .1 don't often have the chance to. take a break and spend time with my friends. Once in a blue moon I'll have someone over for coffee, or I'll go to a friend's house and hang out ... David ... From tim.e to time I might read some poetry, but I have to be in the right mood. 

 When you do not do the activity the examiner asks you about frequently, you should use a varied range of adverbs of infrequency. 

 Colloquial expressions In addition to never, seldom and rarely (see Language step 1), you can also use the following colloquial expressions to sound more like a native: every once in a while (=sometimes) I play football on Sunday morning every once in a while. 

from time to time (= occasionally) I have friends overfrom time to time. once in a blue moon (=rarely) I drink alcohol once in a blue moon. hardly ever (=almost never) I hardly ever play video games.

Model answers 

Read the model answers from the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David. 

Language step 1 Expressing Degrees of Like 

Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, express degrees oflike. 

 Alice What I particularly like about student life is the golden opportunity it gives me to expand my horizons ... David ... But what I especially value about Nha Trang's location is the fresh seafood we can eat all year round. 

As you can see, Alice and David use different ways to express how much they like different aspects of X. Let's look at some more native speaker ways to express degrees of like: 

 Examples: 

 really especially particularly 

 like enjoy love 

 I really enjoy watching the trees by the lake bend in the wind. I particularly liI& my hometowl1'sfood. I especially love attending my Psychology lectures. 

 verb-ing noun 

Any of the above combinations are fine, and using some varied language will make you sound more like a native speaker. 

---

 Notice that like, love and enjoy can be followed by either a verb-ing or a noun; for examples: I especially like/enjoy/love wall{ing in the countryside. I especially like/enjoy/love the countryside. You cannot say: I like/enjoy/love to wall(j17.g. 

IdJ Exercise 6.1: Error Correction 

 Some of the sentences below are incorrect, some are correct. Identify the incorrect sentences and write the correct sentences in the spaces provided. 

1. I really liking meeting new people. 

2. I particularly to love travelling as part of my job. 

3. She especially enjoys visit the famous sights in my hometown. 

4. I enjoy to taking photographs and sending postcards home.

so 

 Alice ... At university, I can not only increase my knowledge about my major and learn new things like Salsa and yoga, but I can also meet lots of new people. David ... Although we get the odd typhoon every year because we are by the seaside, we also enjoy light sea breezes during the summer ... 

 http://www.nhantriviet.com 

---

 Part One 

 Parallel structure means making sure that the series of words in a sentence are in agreement or in line with each other. The best way to understand this is by looking at some examples: I really enjoy watching plays, writing papers and listening to the school band. My mother particularly likes to dance, go out to restaurants and spend time with the family. As you will notice, all of the verbs in the above sentences have the same form, and so can be said to agree with each other. Many students lose points in the IELTS test because of simple agreement errors such as the following: I especially like reading scientific journals, have fun with my study mates and relaxing on campus. (X) I like to read scientific journals, ha.vejun with my study mates and relaxing on campus. (X) 

IdJ Exercise 6.2: Multiple Choice

Language step 3 Linking Words 

Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use linking words. 

 Alice ... At university, I can not only increase my knowledge about my major and learn new things like Salsa and yoga, but I can also meet lots of new people. David ... Although we get the' odd typhoon every year because we are by the seaside, we also enjoy light sea breezes during the summer. But what I especially value about Nha Trang's location is the fresh seafood we can eat all year round. 

To sound like a native and to improve your score on your speaking test, it's good to show slight comparison, contrast and consequence between ideas and feelings using transitional or linking words. 

 Take a look at the following linking words, and how they are used: but I really like my maths teacher, but I like my science teacher more. 

however My major is history; however, I find art class more exciting. 

although Although I study hard most of the time, I always find time for fun on the weekends. I always find time for fun on the weekends, although I study hard most of the time.

 Model answers Read the model answers from the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David. 

 Language step 1 Types of People Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, describe different types of people. 

 Alice ... Generally speaking, I would say that the majority of high school and university male students regularly play football. As for watching football, I think most Vietnamese men of all ages frequently watch English Premier League matches .. .! don't believe football is very popular with many Vietnamese women. David ... As a rule, the younger generation usually listens to pop, rock or hip-hop music, whereas the older people tend to listen to older Vietnamese songs or folk music. I think many wealthy people listen to classical music, sometimes going to live concerts. 

Notice that both Alice and David say what types of people X is popular with. Talking about types of people is a great way to sound like a native speaker when answering Is X popular (in your country)? type questions. Remember: A country is made up of different types of people, different groups. These different groups have different interests and likes and dislikes. So, don't just speak for the whole nation and say: People in my country like to drink tea. 

---

 Part One 

 A native speaker will talk about the types of people that X is popular with, rather than saying that all people like it. So, a better answer that does not generalise -would be: In general, a lot of elderly Vietnamese people like drinking tea, though there are some who do not like tea. 

 Now let's look at some more words talking about the different types of people that make up a society: 

 I • the older generation the elderly younger people school kids the younger generation adolescents 

- I 

IdJ Exercise 7.1: Matching 

- I retired people office workers white-collar workers unemployed people housewives job seekers 

 poor people rich people the working classes the middle classes the upper classes the lower classes 

 Match the words on the left with the words on the right that have a similar meaning. 

1. elderly people A. the unemployed 

2. office workers B. wealthy people 

3. the lower classes C. adolescents 

4. teenagers D. the older generation 

5. the upper classes E. poor people 

6. job seekers F. white-collar workers 

IdJ Exercise 7.2: Gap Fill 

 Write the words below in the correct spaces. 

1. Traditional Vietnamese activities such as playing Chinese chess and drinking tea are still     very popular with in Vietnam. 

2. Bikes are not as popular as they were a few years ago. Now, bikes are mostly ridden by poor     people (such as ) and at school and college. 

3. The bus is mainly popular with students and travelling to and from work; most     tend to have their own cars and take taxis everywhere.

 Language step 2 Qyantity Words Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the quantity words. 

 Alice ... Generally speaking, I would say that the majority oJhigh school and university male students regularly play football...I think most Vietnamese men of all ages frequently watch English Premier League matches .. .! don't believe football is very popular with many Vietnamese women. David ... Most people in Vietnam listen to music every day .. .! think many wealthy people listen to dassical music, sometimes going to live concerts. 

- 

 Again, you will have noticed that both David and Alice use quantity words in their answers so that they do not generalise. 

 Look at the following quantity words which you should master so that you also don't generalise about people: most I think most people like to occasionally watch and play sports. 

 the majority of ?'he majority oJteenagers listen to pop music at least once a week. a lot of I believe a. lot oj people will decide to study abroad in the future. (not) many Not marry elderly people are interested in basketball. a small percentage of Only a small percenta.ge aJstudents have their own cars. very few In my opinion, very Jew poor people have the chance to study English. 

IdJ Exercise 7.3: Rephrasing 

 Rephrase the sentences below using the words in brackets. 

1. All Vietnamese people regularly play badminton when they are young. (a lot of) 

2. No women play golf in Vietnam. (not many)

4. Nobody at my university play table tennis. (very few) 

5. Everyone watched the Thang Long-Ha Noi 1,OOO-year Anniversary Celebration. (most) 

6. No rich people ever ride a bike. (a small percentage of) 

Language step 3 Expressions of Habit 

Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use expressions of habit. 

 Alice ... Genera1ly speaJ?jng, I would say that the majority of high school and university male students regularly play football ... David .. .As a rule, the younger generation usually listens to pop, rock or hip-hop music, whereas the older people ten.d to listen to older Vietnamese songs or folk music ... 

When you are trying to talk about a lot of people, you should also use different expressions of habit so that you don't generalise too much. 

 Look at the following expressions to say what people usually or normally do: 

in general 

 In general, people in India like to eat spicy food. 

generally speaking Generally speak,jng, English people don't really learn many other languages. 

as a rule 

 This expression simply means generally, and has nothing to do with rules. As a rule, the older generation tends to be more traditional than the younger generation. 

more often than not Businessmen drive cars to work more often than not. 

tend to Most people in my country tend to enjoy playing chess.

 Many companies have a bonus scheme to reward staff that work hard. This obviously provides an incentive for the staff to do a good job. I've never been good at rock climbing; I think it's because my arms aren't strong enough. I absolutely love hiking; it's great to walk through green fields, meadows, up hills and through valleys. My little nephew Daniel is really into aeroplanes; he's always running around the house with a toy aeroplane in his hand and making engine noises. A few years ago, my sister broke her leg when she tried sledging -the hill she went down was far too big. 

 Although snowboarding is really fashionable, I'm too frightened of hurting myself to try it. 

 My favourite time of the year is the depth of winter. Then, there's usually lots of snow, people are on holiday from work and I can enjoy sitting in front of the fire with a good book.

Language step 1 Superlatives 

Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the superlative forms. 

 Alice I think the best time of year to do outdoor activities is either in the summer or in the winter ... The weather between June and early September provides the best conditions for rock climbing, hiking, mountain biking or playing sports like tennis ... David I think the best time of day to study is in the very early morning, just after dawn. This is the quietest time of day .. .It's definitely tbe most productive time of day for me, I just find it difficult to get up so early!

5. The time when people give presents the most is certainly Christmas. 

6. However, in Vietnam, I think most people give gifts or presents people's birthdays. 

 Language step 3 Colloquial Expressions for Advantageous Conditions Let's look at how the IELTS candidate Alice uses colloquial expressions for advantageous conditions. 

 [' Alice ... The b.et:veen J une provides the best conditions for L rock chmbmg, hlkmg, mountam biking or playmg sports ... 

 There are many ways to explain the idea that something is the best or the most suitable. We've already looked at superlatives as one way of doing this, but now let's look at some alternative native speaker expressions for this. good / great for The cold weather isgoodfor making ice sculptures. Evenings at home are ISreatfor relaxing and listening to music. ideal for Spring in Beijing is idealfor hiking along the Great Wall. The day before a big national holiday is idealfor throwing a party. provide the perfect conditions for The combination of mountains and lakes near my hometown provides thepelfect conditions for camping in the summer.

 Extra language point Depend on Let's take a look at how the lELTS candidate Alice uses the verb phrase depend on. 

 Alice I think the best time of year to do outdoor activities is either in the summer or in,] the winter because it depends on what activities you would like to do ... 

 When answering What's the best time (of year) to do X? type questions, it would be easy to say things such as Winter in my country is always relaxing or The morning is the best time of day to study. However, such statements are not always true because situations change according to different circumstances and according to people's preferences. The verb phrase depend on helps us qualify what we say. 

Depend on can be used with nouns. 

 The availability of train tickets during the Tet holiday depends on the amount of people travelling. The best time to do exercise depends on people's lifestyles. Or depend on can be used with gerunds (the -ing form of the verb). Finding a good job depends on having good qualifications. Being happy doesn't necessarily depend on being very rich. 

 You should practise using this verb phrase. You will sound more like a native English speaker and be able to give more accurate answers if you can use it well.

 Language step 2 The Past Simple Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the past simple tense. 

 Alice The last time I went on holiday was about three years ago .. .in July 2008. My family and I went to Sa Pa for two weeks during the summer holiday ... my family and I drove out to the mountains there and in the Fansipan ... David The last time visitors came to my house was just last week. It was my wife's birth· day, and so I secretly arranged fo'r a few close friends to over for dinner and drinks. Although it was difficult to keep my wife from finding out, it was quite exciting in a way and certainly a bit of a challenge! In the end, everything went to plan and we all had a great time it was definitely a really enjoyable evening. 

A lot of students, especially when they are nervous in speaking tests, forget to get their past tenses right, especially for irregular verbs. The only way to get it right is to practise. 

 Look at the table below to remind yourself of the past tense forms of some commonly used irregular verbs:

 Language step 3 Adjectives of Experience Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use adjectives of experience. 

 Alice ... Sa Pa is an intrigu ing place to visit of the Dao minority culture ... David ... Although it was difficult to keep my wife from finding out, it was quite exciting in a way and' certainly a bit of a challenge! In the end, everything went to plan and we all had a great time it was definitely a really enjoyable evening. 

Mter saying when you firstllast did X, and using prepositions and adverbs of time and past simple verbs correctly, you should add a few details to describe what the activity was like. 

 Here are some useful adjectives of experience: difficult, challenging for things you learned to do that were not easy but you enjoyed learning' exciting, thrilling, exhilarating, stimulating, enjoyable -for things that you really enjoyed and that were a lot of fun as well as being interesting fascinating, intriguing, surprising -for things or experiences that were new and you felt very curious about them before/while doing them depressing, upsetting, unpleasant -for things that made you feel sad, very uncomfortable embarrassing, humiliating -for things that made you feel very uncomfortable because other people were watching or because you felt silly irritating, annoying, frustrating -for things that you did not enjoy because you thought they were stupid, a waste of time or far too difficult 

Look at some examples of these words in context: The party I attended was really exciting. I am not used to going to parties with people from lots of different countries, so it wasf ascinating to see how everyone behaved. It was surprising to see so many people having different conversations at the same time! The last time I went on holiday was really depressing, if I am honest. It rained the whole time and my mother got sick. It was upsetting andjrustrating because I don't have much time off work and rarely get holidays. I used a computer for the first time when I was in middle school. I found it really embarrassing because my classmates all knew how to use one but I didn't! 

 Notice that Alice and David don't just say simple sentences such as I found it fun. In the above examples, the candidates use adjectives of experience to describe their experiences in a more interesting way and explain why the experiences felt like that.

2. The first time I visited an art gallery was in 2005. My family all went together, and whilst my     parents were not impressed with modern art, for me it was because it was all so new, and it made me consider things I had never really thought deeply about before. 

3. I last had visitors to my home just a few days ago. They were my and my husband's uni-     versity classmates, and it was great because their conversation is so and their     company is really. We talk about everything and anything and we always have     so much fun. 4, The first time I used a computer was on my 12th birthday, when my uncle gave me a laptop as a present.

Language step 1 The Past Simple & Times in Life Phrases 

Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the past simple and times in life phrases. 

 Alice Yes, I did! .. .It was during the ret holiday. My parents bought me a really wonderful new bike ... David I did not learn to swim at school because my school did not have any swimming classes, but I learned to swimfor afew months one summer when my parents took.. me to classes at the local swimming pool. I went every' other day with a small group of friends ... 

David and Alice use past tenses accurately. The past simple can be used here in two different ways: 

Using the past simple to talk about something that finished in the past: 

 I learned to swim ... I did not learn to swim because ... 

Using the past simple to talk about habitual actions in the past: I went every other day ... I practised playing the guitar three evenings a week ... 

It's important to tell the examiner when you did or did not learn to do X using the following times in life phrases: 

when I was + age When I was lOyears old, my grandfather showed me how to make ... 

on my + birthday On my 8 th birthday, I found out how to ...

 Language step 2 Saying Who Taught You Let's have a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, mention the person who taught them to do something. 

I Alice .. .l was taught to ride by my uncle ... 

l David ... We were taught by ... a semi-professional swimmer. 

 Notice how Alice and David use the simple structure I was taught (to do X) by + the person to say who taught them and some information about them. This is a simple language step, but it's important you get it right. 

 Look at these other examples: [ was taught to knit by my auntie ... I was taught to ride a motorbike by my uncle'sfriend ... [ was taught to cook by my grandmother ... 1 was taught to write by myja.ther ... [ was taught to play football by an elder boy who lived in my street ... 

 You can also use I learned (how) to do X from + the person to say who taught you. I learned (how) to play the violinfrom Mr. Cbevins, my teacher. [ learned (how) to sprintfrom my bestfriend, Ben Johnson. I can use spreadsheets well. [learned (how) to Lise themfrom my dad. I love to make short films with a video camera. [learned (how) to use itfrom myfriend, Yorick. 

 Language step 3 Non-defining Relative Clauses and Adjectives of Personality Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use non-defining relative clauses and adjectives of personality. 

 Alice .. .I was taught to ride by my uncle, who was incredibly encouraging but quite strict... David ... We were taught by a really friend(y and supportive man, who was a semi-professional swimmer. 

Notice how after naming the person who taught them, Alice and David go on to say what their personality was like. 

---

 Look at the following useful adjectives of personality: caring supportive encouraging kind understanding talented firm patient/ impatient strict aggressive 

 Part One 

 These adjectives of personality can also be combined with non-defining relative clauses. A non-defining relative clause provides extra information about the person you are talking about, and takes the form who + extra information (for more about relative clauses, see Part Two, Person Monologue Stage 1). There are two ways to use non-defining relative clauses: part of sentence, non -defining relative clause, part of sentence My mother, who was afantastic coolt, taught me how to make bread. sentence, non-defining relative clause I was taught to make bread by my mother, who was afantastic cook, 

 Look at these other examples of sentences combining adjectives of personality and nondefining relative clauses: I was taught by my brother, who was very impatient. I was taught by a neighbour, who was particularly kind and u.nderstanding. When I was young, my friend Daniel, who was firm butfair, taught me how to play tennis. I learned to play cricket from Mr. Philips, who was quite an aggressive and quic/ttempered teacher. 

dJ Exercise 11.2: Error Correction & Matching 

 Each of the sentences 1-5 has one mistake. Identify and correct the mistakes, then match the sentences to their counterparts A-E.

A. ... who was a friendly, creative woman. 

 B ... .I got to grips with them pretty fast, because I'm quite good at anything related to mathematics. 

C. ... They were both very patient and kind. 

 D .... who was an excellent calligrapher and an understanding, encouraging teacher. 

E ... .It took a while to get the hang of, but it was an interesting way to learn. 

Extra language point Phrases to Express Freedom & Constraints 

It's good to use expressions to say why you did or did not learn to do things in your life. Look at these examples and think how you could use such phrases yourself: 

I was lucky because my parents gave me the chance to + activity. 

I was very fortunate that I had the opportunity to + activity. It's a shame I did not have enough time to + activity. It's unfortunate I could not do + activity, because my parents couldn't afford it. I wish I had had more ambition ana patience when I was younger, then I might have learned to do + activity.

 Language step 1 The Present Perfect Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the present perfect tense. 

 Alice I'm from Ho Chi Minh City and it bas certainly changed a lot in recent years. Not so long ago, there were lots more low-rise buildings and narrow streets; now the local government has replaced them with tall apartment buildings ... They have also put a lot more parks in the city and have planted thousands of trees ... David ... Restaurants and eateries have changed a great deal since I was young; .. 

 Notice that Alice and David use the present perfect accurately to talk about changes that have happened. Remember that the structure of the present perfect is: have / has + past participle She has invested lots of money in a KTV bar. The government has spent lots of money on public transport recently. The traffic situation bas become a lot worse in the last few years. 

IdJ Exercise 12.1: Sentence Completion 

 Complete the sentences below by writing the present perfect forms of the verbs in brackets. 

1. In recent years, people (cut) down a lot of trees in the Brazilian jungle. 

2. Cleaner streets, nicer buildings and better transport     this city in the past couple of years. 

 (bring) a lot of tourists to 

3. This week, the authorities ____ (fight) to restore law and order to the city with great     success. 

4. My university campus (undergo) a lot of changes in the past few years. 

5. My parents (spend) a considerable amount of money fitting a new kitchen and     bathroom in our home. 

6. In recent years, fashion (become) much more interesting and stylish.

 Language step 2 The Past Simple & Present Simple Let's look at how the two lELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the past simple and present simple tenses. 

 Alice ... Not so long ago, there were lots more low-rise buildings and narrow streets ... The streets are now much wider than before ... the city is more beautiful. David ... Restaurants and eateries have changed a great deal since I was young. When I was a kid, nearly all restaurants in our city were cheap ... Now, however, a wide range of Vietnamese and many international restaurants line every street. These are a lot cleaner and more elegant than the small eateries ... 

 Alice and David use the past simple and present simple accurately to talk about changes. This may seem like a very simple language point, but many students get a low score on the test for making basic mistakes with these tenses. Look at some example sentences that use these tenses to talk about changes: My town was small; now it is quite big. The streets used to be very quiet; now they are noisy. The shops sold poor-quality clothes; now they sell the latest designer fashions. Before many people ate at small eateries or night markets, but now people choose more expensive restaurants. 

ldJ Exercise 12.2: Sentence Completion 

 Complete the sentences below by writing the correct forms of the verbs (the present simple or past simple) in brackets. 

1. When I was a child, everyone in my area of town had to shower in communal bathrooms in     the street. Now, however, most people (be) wealthy enough to have their own,     modern bathrooms. 

2. Before, many people (go) to small shops or markets to buy groceries. In recent     years, big supermarkets have become very popular. 

3. In the past, the suburbs (not look) very attractive. Now, because the govern-     ment has planted lots of trees and plants, the area (look) very pleasant. 

4. In the past, it _ _ _ (cost) a lot of money to buy aeroplane tickets, but recently prices     have gone down and air travel is more 'accessible to everyone.

Language step 3 Comparative Adjectives 

Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the comparative adjectives. 

 Alice ... now the local government has replaced them with tall apartment buildings with better facilities ... The streets are now much wider than before. They have also put a lot more parks in the city and have planted thousands of trees in the streets, so the city is more beautiful. David ... These are a lot cleaner and more elegan.t than the small eateries, but sadly are more impersonal and much more expensive! 

Notice how Alice and David use a lot of comparatives to explain how their cities have changed and to express whether those changes are good or bad. 

 This is a very important part of your answer, so now let's review comparatives. 

Comparative adjectives 

 We add -er at the end of the adjective, or we add more before the adjective. To form the comparative of an adjective, you should: add -er if the adjective is one syllable long. add -ier if the adjective is two syllables long and ends in -yo add more before the adjective if it is two or more syllables long. 

 Look at the table to refresh your memory. 

 cheap cheaper easy easier expensive more expensive large larger heavy heavier comfortable more comfortable fast faster pretty prettier fashionable more fashionable slow slower ugly uglier useful more useful 

Comparative structure 

 In comparing the past to the present, it is also useful to remember this structure: 

X + is/are + comparative adjective + than + time in the past My city is prettier than it was ten years ago. The university library is much better stocked now than it was before. The city is a lot greener tball it was when I was a child.

David My university campus is quite scruffy and run-down. I suggc t t:he authorities im prove it by spending more money on up-keeping the grounds and moderni ing the classrooms ... 

Notice how both Alice and David start by identifying the problem, then go on to use the structure improve X + by + verb-ing/ make X + comparative + by + verb-ing to talk about changes they would make or they suggest others make. 

For changes you would make 

would improve X + by + verb-ing / would make X + comparative + by + verb-ing I would improve my bedroom by putting posters on the walls. I would mal?f my living room cosier by buying a new sofa. I would improve my flat by getting a new wardrobe.

 Alice .. .I would have the windows made bigger and lighter curtains made andfitted ... David .. .IfI were in authority, I would have new classrooms built, I would have the sports fadli ties repaired ... 

 Notice how Alice and David use the structure would have + something + past participle to talk about what they would get others to do. First look at the difference between the active (what you would do) and the passive (what you would get others to do): 

 100 

 I would the windows bigger. = I would do it myself. I would have the windows made bigger. = I would get someone else to come and do it for me.

For native speakers, it's not very good to make absolute statements like All people like ... or Everyone in Western countries thinks ... This doesn't sound very clever and can sometimes be rude. Even in one country or one culture, many people have different ways of life and different opinions. 

You should use expressions for quantities of people and types of people to qualify your statements so that they are not so generalised. 

 You can use these expressions for quantities of people: most the majority of a large percentage of nearly all a vast amount of few hardly any not many a minority of only some 

You can combine them with the expressions for types of people to say which people in society usually do something or believe something. 

 young people / the younger generation / teenagers / adolescents old people / the elderly / the older generation office workers/business people/white-collar workers the working classes / middle classes / very wealthy people unemployed people/the poor/homeless people young kids/ schoolchildren/ university students/ graduate students

 Usually, when native speakers talk about the ways in which they find information, they will tell each other how much they trust or mistrust that information. Here's a list of useful words: to express trust It's a very objective source of information. It's quite unbiased, so I generally believe what I see on that news channel. I believe that the information presented there is impartial. I trust that newspaper because it is very well respected. to express doubt or slight mistrust I don't like Internet news, I think it can be very biased. It's considerably one-sided in its approach to discussing international affairs. It's an untrustworthy publication. I find the news channel a little unreliable to be honest.

 John: Do you think that people should be allowed to keep wild animals at home? Mary: Certainly! I am that wild animals should be kept in zoos, or in their natural habitat. John: Do you believe that people get enough holidays? Mary: Yes, I certainly! This is a developing country and in my ____ , everyone must work hard to make the country better and better. John: Do you think that parks should be free for everyone to enter? Mary: Of! I strongly that parks need to be maintained, plants and flowers need to be watered and the places kept clean. That costs money. 

 Language step 2 Rights, Fairness & Permission Expressions Let's look at how the two lELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the rights, fairness and permission expressions. 

 I Alice .. .I strongly believe that workers deserve to be given longer paid h0:=Jidays ... David ... Young people ou.ght to be given more choice in what they wear ... ---

 When talking about permission and rights, you should use the passive voice. Using the passive voice means that you can say who receives the action without needing to say who does the action. 

 The passive structure Remind yourself of the passive structure: subject + be + past participle The workers are given. three weeks' holiday every year. The children were allowed to wear casual clothes last week. People today are not provided with enough benefits. 

 In each case above, we know that the people giving the workers three weeks' holiday, allowing the children to wear casual clothes and who ought to be giving people more benefits are bosses, teachers and authorities. 

---

 U sing the passive to suggest To make suggestions, native speakers normally combine verbs such as should and ought to with the passive. Note in the following examples how these are used and that (to) be is added before the past participle: should (not) be + past participle ought (not) to be + past participle (don't) deserve to be + past participle should (not) be allowed to + verb should (not) be permitted to + verb 

 Look at these in the context of the following examples: People who work longer hours deserve to be paid more money. Workers ought to be treated more fairly. Women ought not to be discriminated against at work. Children should not be allowed to work.. until they are 18 years old. Employees should be permitted to wear casual clothes to work. Fathers should be given extra holidays to spend time with their family. All workers deserve to be provided with a safe working environment.

 Part One 

 Language step 3 The Zero Conditional Let's have a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the zero conditional. 

 Alice ... if people are given more paid holidays, they are more loyal to their companies in the long term and probably work,harder because they are more contented with their jobs. David ... If children are controlled too much when they are young, they can become very rebellious in later years. 

 Alice and David use the zero conditional to talk about what generally happens if certain conditions are fulfilled. It's often used for things that are almost always true. The structure for the zero conditional is as follows: if + present verb + present verb Ijwe b'avel to work by subway, we usually get there quicker. If I go to music concerts, I always dance. Ifworkers are late, they get into trouble. 

 Look at how the zero conditional is used with the passive: if + passive + present verb Ijpeople are given more paid holidays, they are more loyal to their company. If children are allowed to play computer games too much, they get really lazy. Ijyoung people are made to wear uniforms in school, they are generally better behaved.

1. quite / fairly 

2. relatively / comparatively 

3. pretty 

4. really 

5. considerably / very / remarkably

6. My schoolmate Saskia Clarke has become something of a after competing in the     2008 Olympics. 

 Language step 2 Relative Clauses with "Who" Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Sophia andJean, use relative clauses with who. 

 Sophia I would like to talk about my grandmother. When I was a child, my parents were very busy and so my grandmother, who is myfather's mother, had to look after me ... Jean I want to talk about my next-door neighbc:mr Win. We moved to our'family home when I was only six months old, so Win is the earliest neighbour that I can remember. Win, who lived with her daughter and son-in-law, was always a very elderly woman ... 

 Notice that Sophia and Jean use parts of sentences (clauses) beginning with who to provide the examiner with information about the person they are talking about. These are called relative clauses. There are two main types of relative clause, defining and non-defining. Look at the examples below. Non-defining relative clause My mother, who as a waitressfor many years, thoroughly dislikes politics. Her good friend Daniel, who became a very successful businessman, had suggested to her once that she study computer programming. In these examples, the relative clause gives extra information about the person being spoken about. The information is not necessary because if we were to remove the relative

 Part Two 

 clause, the sentence would still make sense: My mother thoroughly dislil?§s politics.! Her good fr iend Daniel had suggested to her once that she study computer programming. 

 When speaking, you should have a slight pause at the beginning and end of your nondefining relative clauses. Defining relative clause The woman who lived next door to us when! was a child was extremely ugly. The movie star who starred ill the film fital1.ic has become hugely successful. 

 These relative clauses are necessary to the meaning of the sentence and are not giving extra information. If we removed the relative clause, the sentence would not make good sense as we would not know which woman or which movie star was being talked about: rhe woman was extremely ugly.!T'he movie star has become hugely successful. When using a defining relative clause, you should not pause but speak continuously. Note: whom is very rarely used in spoken relative clauses -just use who. 

rdJ Exercise 21.3: Gap Fill 

 Write the relative clauses below in the correct spaces. 

- ' \uglit 'IS Ina 118 llati

. , 

5. Her uncle, 

6. The relative 

 , used to come and pick us up in his enormous black car. sponsored her visa application to the United States. 

 Language step 3 The Past Continuous & Past Simple to Say How You Met Somebody Mike describes how he met Dr. Shotter: 

 Mike I will always remember Dr. Shotter. He was one of my history teachers at university. I had always loved history at school and college and so I chose history as my major at university. When I was choosing my courses, I decided to try Roman HistOly and so met Dr. Shotter ... 

---

 When introducing somebody, it's often useful to say how, or under what circumstances, you met. Using the past continuous and past simple is a good way to do this. The past continuous is used together with the past simple to talk about a longer action that was happening when a single or shorter action happened. The structure of the past continuous is: be + verb-ing I was wall{jng ... They were talkjng on the phone. 

 When or while is often used to link the past continuous and past simple, as in the following examples: When I was studying at university, my teacher told me to spend more time researching my subject. While my brother was visiting Vietnam, he lost his passport, wallet, and credit cards. We met when we were working together at the same company. I first tall?td to my girlfriend when I asktd her the time while we were waiting for the bus.

Model answers 

 Most middle-aged men in England have a large beer belly because they drink far too much beer and do too little exercise. Most schoolchildren are made to learn the multiplication table so well that they all know it off by heart for the rest of. their lives. I don't like that waitress; whenever you ask her to do something or you ask her a question, she always scowls. Loads of people love Rod Stewart's songs because of his hoarse voice, but I think he just sounds like he has a cold. He said he spilled the drink on her lap by accident, but I know he spilled it on purpose because he was angry at her.

Language step 1 Adjectives of Personality 

Let's look at how the three IELTS candidates, Sophia, Mike and Jean, use adjectives of personality. 

 Sophia ... My grandmother is a very gentle and kjnd woman. Her hair -as far back as I can remember has always been brilliant white but she is quite self-conscious about this and wears a shoulder-length wig to hide it... Mike ... Dr. Shotter was a very experienced history lecturer ... Jean ... When people saw her, they would be struck immediately by the expression on her face, which often appeared to be a scowl. Actually, she was a very friendly and gentle woman ... 

When giving a monologue about a person, it's very important to accurately use adjectives of personality to describe what the person is / was like. 

[http://www.nhant](http://www.nhant) •. iviet.com 159

 Look at some more examples of useful adjectives of personality: 

 Funny Shy Confident Angry Happy humorous reserved ambitious aggressive charming witty introverted self-confident bad-tempered cheerful funny quiet self-assured moody vivacious hilarious sensitive extroverted irritable lively amusing conservative adventurous short-fused hysterical timid arrogant abrupt 

 InteIlig'cnt Stupid clever immature supportive frank bright silly sympathetic reliable generous mature dumb helpful genuine loving talented dim sincere thol!lghtful open-minded daft altruistic wise foolish 

 Examples: He is a very extroverted person, and really likes to be the centre of attention. She seems like a very vivacious and self-assured woman, though she's perhaps quite abrupt if you make her angry. My girlfriend really has two sides to her personality; when she's happy she can be openminded, thoughtfuL and really supportive, but when she's in a bad mood she can be really irritable and selfish.

6. Bill Gates is obviously an extremely man; otherwise he wouldn't have been so     successful. 

7. One thing I really appreciated about my grandparents was that they were so 

- they gave me whatever I needed and didn't really care about money. 

8. I think my uncle is still not married because he is extremely. He doesn't like to     say much when other people are present and his views are quite traditional. 

9. My doctor is fantastic -even though her patients are really nervous about seeing the doc-     tor or going to the hospital, she is so that she can make them laugh and relax     straight away. 

10. Although David Beckham is a great football player, he isn't very - don't ask 

 him any complicated maths questions! 

Language step 2 Adverbs of Frequency for Habits and Behaviour 

Let's have a look at how the three lELTS candidates, Sophia, Mike and Jean, use adverbs of frequency for habits and behaviour. 

 Sophia ... When I think of my grandmother's appearance, the thing which stands out most is her constantly smiling face ... Mike ... Dr. Shotter was about 60 years old and had a huge beer belly. His hair was grey, but quite thick. He always used to have glasses with him but he hardly ever wore them they usually just dangled around his neck from the glasses strap .. .! remember that he always brought a lot of teaching notes to class but would then put them down and never look at the, notes again the whole time he was teaching 

- he knew the information off by heart. .. Jean ... When people saw her, they would be struck immediately by the expression on her face, which often appeared to be a scowl...Win was originally from London and had a very strong London accent and was never without a cigarette ... When I visited her she would also be very kind to me, offering to make me a cup of tea, but would usually have some bad words to say about' her son-in-law, as he often annoyed her on purpose ... 

 Adverbs offrequency are great for describing people's habits and behaviour. 

---

 Refresh your memory of useful adverbs offrequency by looking at the table below. 

 constantly frequently regularly typically commonly often sometimes occasionally rarely seldom hardly ever almost never always usually generally never every now and again from time to time 

 You can also talk about how often people do or did things by using the structure: Times + time period once a day twice a week three times a month five times a year 

 Examples: 

 Every + time every morning every evening every day at 6 p.m. every week every month every birthday every summer vacation 

 My friend Omar has to wash five times a day, every day. My grandmother would regularly go to the temple to pray and offer gifts. Every summer vaca.tion, my father would think of a special trip for us to go on. 

IdJ Exercise 21.6: Gap Fill 

 Write the words and phrases below in the correct spaces.

3. A teenager that lives near me meets his friends and statts drinking at 7 p.m. 

4. When Tracy was young, she went to many different places as her family would ___ _     go on vacation 

5. Although my mother loves Chinese food, she only eats at a Chinese restaurant     because they are too expensive.

6. Bob's grandmother had lots of problems with her memory. She couldn't remember new     information and forgot where she lived -she had to have a piece of paper with     her address written on it at all times. 

Language step 3 The Past Continuous, Past Simple & Past Perfect Tenses to Tell Anecdotes Let's see how the three IELTS candidates, Sophia, Mike and Jean, tell anecdotes about their lives. 

 Sophia .. .I remember once when we were playing hide-and-seek at home, I ran into the garden and hid well that she couldn'tfind me. It was quite a few hours before I decided to come out and my grandmother was so relieved -she had almost called the police! Mike .. .I remember once when he organised a university trip to a historical site.' I had brought my girlfriend along, even though my girlfriend always said that history was boring. In the end, Dr. Shotter told my girlfriend about the history of the place and she was amazed ... Jean .. .r remember that Win did all the cleaning in the house while her son-in-law, Fred, and her daughter were out at work. To annoy her, Fred would often stub his cigarette out not in the ashtray but on the kitchen floor -making her go crazy!... 

 Notice that Sophia, Mike andJean all tell anecdotes (interesting or amusing short stories) about the people they are describing. This makes their monologue much more interesting and is a great way to show what someone's personality and behaviour are like. You should remember how to use the past continuous and past simple from the last lesson, where you learnt to talk about how you met somebody. This is very useful for telling, anecdotes. Examples: The teacher was getting really angry, but David didn't realise and continued making stupid jokes. I was travelling on a bus in Laos when there was a loud crash and the bus started shaking all over the road. You can also use the past perfect and past simple to tell anecdotes. 

 The structure of the past perfect is: had + past participle I had eaten a huge dinner. They had decided that they would ... 

---

 The past perfect action happened before the past simple action, as in the following examples: Last Christmas, I had eatel1 a huge dinner at my mother's house and then my girlfriend's mother made me eat another enormous meal. They had decided that they would visit some historical sites, but on the bus on the way they were robbed.

Model answers 

Read the model answers from the three IELTS candidates, Sophia, Mike andJean. 

Language step 1 The Third Conditional 

Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Sophia and Mike, use the third conditional sentences. 

 Sophia ... My grandmother has always taught me to be more patient and understanding towards other people. She had been a nurse for many years and I think ifit hadn't been for her, I would never have studied nursing -which I love ... Mike ... He had a great influence upon me, and made me want to become a history lecturer myself. I'm sure I wouldn}t have studied a Master's degree in Roman History ifl hadn}t met Dr. Shotter ... 

 Let's look at how the third conditional is constructed: 

if + had(n't) + past participle + would(n't) have + past participle lfit hadn}t been for her, I would never have studied nursing. 

would(n't) have + past participle + if + had(n't) + past participle I wouldn't have studied a Master's degree in Roman History if I hadn't met Dr. Shotter. Both constructions are possible for each third conditional sentence and mean exactly the same thing. 

 The third conditional is used to talk about: 

Things that did not happen in the past 

 lfmy teacher hadn't been so relaxed, I'm sure I would have studied harder. (My teacher was too relaxed, so I didn't study hard enough.)

Things that might not have happened this explains why the opposite things happened if Bill Gates badn't been so ambitious, he wouldn't have been so successful. (Bill Gates was very ambitious, and this is why he has been so successful.) Jjmy niece hadn't been so lazy at school, she wouldn't havejailed all her exams.

 Language step 2 The Present Perfect for Talking about Changes and Achievements Let's look at how the IELTS candidate Sophia uses the present perfect tense. 

 Sophia ... My grandmother has always taught· me to be more patient and ] towards other people ... 

 When giving a monologue about a person, it's a good idea to talk about the changes or achievements that person has made. For this, you need to use the present penect. Remember the structure of the present penect is: have/has + past participle My grandfather has had a great influence on my life. She has become one of the most famous actresses in the world. My nephew has helped me to see that family is the most important thing.

Let's look at how the three IELTS candidates, Sophia, Mike and Jean, use expressions of size and shape. 

 Sophia ... Most of the Summer Palace is actually Kunming Lake, a large open area of water.

Mike .. .I would like to talk about a bar called D22 .. .It's really a sma.1I place, although it's quite lOl1.gwhen you get inside ... Jean ... The apartment would have at least two huge bedrooms, one lounge, a m,assive kitchen and one or two bathrooms it'd be great if one of the bathrooms was en suite!... ' 

 To describe the place of your monologue well, you should say something about its size. Have a look at the following really useful size and shape words: 

 Ii 1 huge/large little narrow towering long massive tiny wide high short vast minute broad tall winding enormous minuscule thin short endless gigantic cramped thick low far-reaching immense squat 

However, you should be a little careful about how native speakers use these words to describe different things. It's important to remember these adjective + noun collocations: 

 a vast mountain range / landscape / lake / desert a massive / gigantic / huge / enormous / immense building/house/ shopping complex/ room a cramped room/house/ dormitory a broad avenue/ street a squat house/building a tall / high building / mountain a winding path/ country road/ mountain pass a tiny/minuscule / incredibly small object/ doorway /window

 You can also use the following phrases to talk about the dimensions of the place: (number) metres / kilometres by (number) metres / kilometres Ba Dinh Square is 32 0 metres by 100 metres. 

 (number) metres / kilometres square The size of Ba Be Lake in Bac Kan is about 6.5 kilometres square.

 Sophia ... For me, the Summer Palace is a beautiful, open area which represents the best of Chinese culture and history. Most of the Summer Palace is actually Kunming Lake, a large open area of water. The lake is surrounded by a large number of hills on which are various examples of traditional Chinese architecture ... Mike ... To be honest, D22 is not an attractive place: not only does it always seem dark.., and dingy no matter how many lights are on but there is also a permanent smell of cigarette smoke in the air ... Jean ... The flat would be on a high floor perhaps the top floor of a brand-new high-rise apartment block with the most modern architectural S0'le ... The style would be modem, with varnished wooden floorboards, leather sofas and colourful rugs on the floor. The flat would be very airy and ligbt, with lots of windows ... 

 As you can see, all of these model answers include words and expressions to accurately describe the appearance and character of a place. You should use them in your monologue to sound much more like a native.

Truc Bach Lake in Ha Noi has lots of pedal boats which the public can hire for a few hours. Nowadays the shopping mall near my house has arranged people to stop children messing around there -not like when I was a child, when we would always play lots of games there. The bands that play at the bar in the centre of town are pretty good, but I don't think they'll ever become famous. I used to go to that gym to play sports every week, but then they raised their prices and it was too expensive to go. to spend time (with somebody) in On weekends I generally hang out at a certain place the shopping mall with my friends. to raise a child; to care for a child from childhood to adulthood

Model answers 

Read the model answers from the three IELTS candidates, Sophia, Mike andJean. 

Language step 1 The Passive Voice to Express Purpose / Significance of a Place 

Let's have a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Sophia and Jean, use the passive voice in their monologues. 

 Sophia ... Or,iginally, the palace was built by the emperor as his private palace and used to be closed to the public ... Jean ... A flat like this would be perfect for my husband and I to live in and then bring up our child. A new, gleaming kitchen would be great for preparing delicious dishes for our friends when they come to dinner, and the guests could be entertained in the comfortable and relaxing sitting room ... 

Notice that both Sophia andJean use the passive to talk about the pUIpose or significance of the place they are describing. 

This is a very useful and native speaker way to talk about a place, so let's remind ourselves of the passive structure: be + past participle (+ by + agent) The Pyramids of Egypt were constructed by unpaid workers. Classical music is pelformed there every week. This famous site is respected and admired by locals and tourists alike.

- it was great! ... 

 The place that you give a monologue about will often be somewhere you have a personal history with, or somewhere you have been many times.

 Extra language point Avoid Saying "My country has a long history!" When taking the IELTS oral test, many students say the following types of sentence: My country has a very long history. My hometown is a city with a long history. 

 While factually and grammatically correct, you need to remember that IELTS examiners become very bored with almost every candidate saying My country has a long history. Also, if you say this kind of thing in an exam, it can sound a bit arrogant because other countries also have incredibly long histories of many thousands of years.

Language step 1 Adjectives of Appearance 

Let's look at how the three IELTS candidates, Sophia, Mike and Jean, use adjectives of appearance. 

 Sophia ... As you know, mobile phones nowadays are very light, compact and sleek .. tele-· phones made of plastic, which can be carried everywhere very conveniently ... Mike .. .It was a fairly simple kite: about a metre long', diamond-shaped and it had four colours -red, blue, yellow and orange I think. It was made of plastic and light wood, so it was very light ... Jean .. .It is a beautiful, almost marble statue that depicts a scene from the Trojan War ... 

When giving a monologue about an object, as soon as you have said what the object is, you should then describe its appearance. 

 To describe an object well, it's important that you use the correct adjective order as below. (Generally, we don't use more than three adjectives together at the same time.) 

 lovely 

Examples: 

 a metre long old round 

 ... a beautif ul, almost marble statue. The kite was about a metre long, diamond-shaped. ... an old round green ball. ... a lovely red Chinese lantern. 

 green red Chinese 

 Now look at the following useful native speaker adjectives of appearance:

Mil e .. .It was a. fairly simple kite: about a metre long, diamond-shaped and it had four colours red, blue, yellow and orange I think. It was made of plastic and light wood, so it was very light I remember I was able to carry it to the park all by myself... 

---

 When talking about an object and its appearance, you might want to talk about what the object is made of. Look at the following expressions: made of Use made of when you can still recognise the material/things used to make the object. The dress is made of silk. A light bulb is made of glass and metal. 

 made from Use made from when you cannot recognise the material/things used to make the object. My model airplane was madefrom paper and glue. The sculpture is made from old tin cans and bicycle parts. 

 Language step 2 Indirect Object to Explain Possession Let's see how the two IELTS candidates, Sophia and Mike, use indirect objects to explain possession. 

 Sophia ... My parents bought me my first mobile phone one Tet holiday when I was a teenager and I've had one ever since ... Mil<e I would like to talk about' a kite I was given. My father gave n:ze it for my ninth birthday ... 

 If you are talking about an object that you have or had before, you should tell the examiner how you came to possess the object. Using the indirect object sentence structure is a very useful way to do this. There are two indirect object sentence structures: subject + verb + indirect object + direct object She gave me a letter. I bought her a car. 

subject + verb + direct object + to / for + indirect object She gave a letter to me. I bought a car for her. The indirect object is the recipient of the direct object (e.g. 1 am the recipient of the letter. She is the recipient of the car.). 

 There are quite a few verbs that can be used in these types of sentence, including: ask lend send 

 bring make show 

 build offer take 

 buy paint teach 

 get read tell 

 give sell write

IdJ Exercise 23.2: Error Correction 

 Identify the mistakes in the following sentences.

2. I bought a painting to my mother. 

3. My friend wrote to I a story. 

4. My father bought I a book. 

5. It I gave to a classmate. 

6. Them I asked to buy for me it. 

 Language step 3 The Past Simple & Past Continuous to Say How You Know about the Object Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Sophia and Jean, use the past simple and past continuous in their monologues. 

 Sophia ... My parents bought me my first mobile phone one Tet holiday when I was a teenager and I've had one ever since ... Jean .. .I saw this statue many times in books when I was at school, as my major was art history, but I finally got to see the real thing when I went to' Italy for my job about a year ago ... 

 When you are giving a monologue about an object, you should use the past simple or the past simple with the past continuous to explain why you have the object or how you know about the object. Look at the following native speaker examples: Past simple I bou.ght myself a laptop many years ago. My parents too/t the photograph when I was very young. I saw the work of art when my family went to the art gallery. 

 Past continuous and past simple As you may remember, the past continuous is used together with the past simple to talk about a longer action that was happening when a shorter action happened. So, in the sentence I was washing the dishes when I broke a plate, the breaking of the plate was a short action that happened during the longer action of washing the dishes. The structures are as follows: past simple + when / while + past continuous I saw the Statue of Liberty when I was studying in America. My parents bought the furniture while they were living in Binh Duong.

 when / while + past continuous + past simple While I was visiting my uncle for Christmas, I got a great toy. When my sister was travelling in Europe, she too/{,a fantastic photograph.

 Model answers Read the model answers from the three lELTS candidates, Sophia, Mike and Jean. 

Language step 1 The Passive Voice for, Creation & Application 

Let's look at how the three IELTS candidates, Sophia, Mike and Jean, use the passive voice in their monologues. 

 Sophia ... Not only are mobile phones used for talking to people and sending text messages but also for surfing the Web, keeping a diary and even as an alarm clock! Some of the most expensive mobile phones are bought by people who want to show off and display their wealth -they're often a status symbol.

 Notice that all of the above model answers use the passive voice to explain whom the objects were made by and what they are made or used for. You probably remember the structure of the passive voice from previous lessons, but here's a quick reminder: be + past participle (+ by + agent) The plane was in.vented by the Wright brothers. The wheel is an invention that has been used for hundreds of years in millions of different tools and machines all over the world. The photograph was before I was born.

 Language step 3 Phrases for the First / Last Time Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Sophia and Mike, use the phrases for the first or last time they do something. 

 Sophia .. .1 last used my mobile phol1e just before this speakil1g test my mum sent me a message to wish me luck! ...

It seemed so thrilling to have a brand-new kite to fly, and my dad to help me fly it. 1hatfirst day wejlew the kitefor hours and hours, my dad showing me how to get the kite into the air, then how to fly it... 

 If you are talking about an object that you used or still use, you should talk about the first or last time that you used it, just like Sophia and Mike do in their model answers. To do this, you can use the phrasesforthefirstllasttime : the first / last time + past verb + was + time in the past 1hefirst time I used a computer was about lOyears ago. The last time I saw the painting was in 1997. 

 I + first/last + past verb + time in the past lfirst Llsed a computer about 10 years ago. J last saw the painting in 1997.

Read the model answers from the three IELTS candidates, Sophia, Mike and Jean. 

Language step 1 Adjectives for Evaluation 

Let's see how the three IELTS candidates, Sophia, Mike and Jean, use the adjectives for evaluation. 

 Sophia .. .I think mobile phones are an extremely practical piece of equipment to have ... Today, a mobile phone is an essential piece of technology for everyone, which is used every day ... Despite being slightly more expensive than a landline, mobile phones are so useful and convenient that many people simply couldn't do without one ... Mike ... Although it wasn't such a valuable gift, I didn't mind because I was just pleased to receive such a cool present! ... Jean .. .I think the statue is such afantastic work of art because although it portrays men suffering, it's a wonderfully vivid sculpture. Whenever I see it, I immediately sympathise with the pain and suffering of the figures whilst at the same time, I can appreciate the extremely high-quality work ...

 Part Two 

Notice that Sophia, Mike andJean all use adjectives for evaluation in their monologues to describe the objects in more detail. This makes the monologue more interesting, more accurate and more like a native speaker's. Let's look at some more really useful adjectives for evaluation : 

 Appearance , Value "

 a good 

Let's look at how the lELTS candidate Sophia uses comparatives and comparative structures. 

 Sophia ... Despite being slightly more expensive than a landline, mobile phones are so useful and convenient that many people simply couldn't do without one ... 

When evaluating an object, you should use comparatives and comparative structures to compare the object to others. 

Comparatives 

As you may remember from previous lessons, when we want to make a comparative, we add -er or -ier to the end of the adjective, or we add more before the adjective. 

 We add -er to adjectives that are one syllable long. With adjectives that finish in -y and have two syllables, we add -ier. We put the word more before adjectives that have two or more syllables.

Pay attention to the expressions in italics by Sophia and Mike in their monologues. 

 Sophia ... As for me, I couldn't bear to part with my mobile phone it gives me so much independence and freedom, and the games are great too! Mike ... Some years later the kite got broken, I don't remember how. But I remember seeing the broken kite andfeeling realty upset, like I'd lost a part of my childhood. Now, whenever I see children flying kites at my local park, T always start feeling nostalgic, and thin/tabout when I was young. 

Notice that both Sophia and Mike use the above expressions to indicate why the object they are describing is special or important to them. Let's look at some more useful words and expressions for attachment to objects: 

Adjectives for how an object makes you feel 

 nostalgic sentimental (about) homesick inspired intrigued

 Language step 2 The Second & Third Conditionals for Expressing the Importance of Objects Let's look at how the IELTS candidate Sophia uses the second conditional in her monologue below. 

 [ Sophia ... if! bad to trips out with my friends a few days in advance contact friends who live far away by letter, life just wouldn't be as much fun ... 

Notice that Sophia uses the second conditional to emphasise the importance of the object she is describing. 

 The structures of the second conditional are as follows: If + past verb, would(n't) + verb Ifl didn't: have my laptop, I wouldn't be able to study English online. Ifmy family had a dishwasher, we wouldn't need to spend so much time washing up. Ifl won the lottery, I would buy an enormous truck. 

 would(n't) + verb + if + past verb I wouldn't be able to study English online if l didn't have my laptop. My family wouldn't need to spend so much time washing up if we had a dishwasher. I would buy an enormous truck if l won the lottery. 

As you can see from these examples, the second conditional is used to talk about present or future situations that are very unlikely or impossible to happen. So, you can use the second conditional to talk about what your life would be like if you had or didn't have the object you are talking about. 

---

 Part Two 

 You can also use the third conditional to explain why a certain object is important. Let's look at how the third conditional is constructed: If + had(n't) + past participle, would(n't) have + past participle if computers hadn't been invented, the world economy wou/dn 't have developed so quickly in the last 30 years. If I had seen the movie on my own, I would've been really scared. 

 would(n't) have + past participle + if + had(n't) + past participle The world economy wouldn't have developed so quickly in the last 30 years if computers hadn't been invented. I would've been really scared if I had seen. the movie on my own. 

 Notice from the above examples that the third conditional is used to talk about: 1) Things that did not happen in the past 2) Things that might not have happened -this explains why the opposite things happened

 Language step 3 The Present Perfect for Expressing the Importance of Objects Let's have a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Sophia and Jean, use the present perfect tense to express the importance of objects. 

 Sophia .. .I think that everyone has got used to simply picking up their mobile phone and communicating immediately ... Jean .. .In fact, this statue has been famolils throughout history and has inspired many other artists and their works of art. 

 As you can see from the above extracts, Sophia and Jean use the present perfect to explain why their objects are important or special. As you probably remember from previous lessons, the present perfect is constructed like this: have / has + past participle We use the present peifect to talk about recent changes (Computers have become essential to business.), for things that happened in the past that are connected with the present (The government has greatly developed the subway system.), or for experiences (I have watched every movie by James Cameron.).

. As well as giving a long talk, we also had to recite famous and act in a with the other contestants. 

5. The story I really like is the "Cinderella", which is about the girl with two ugly     sisters who marries a prince. 

 Language step 2 Prepositions of Time & Time Phrases Let's see how the three IELTS candidates, Sophia, Mike and Jean, use prepositions of time and time phrases. 

 Sophja I want to talk about a story called "The Boy Who Cried Wolf'. When.] was a child ...

It was in my last year at secondary school, when I was taking my final exams ... 

 As you can see from the above model answer extracts, it's important to use prepositions of time or time phrases in your monologue to explain when the past event happened like a native speaker. First, remind yourself of the following essential prepositions of time for specific times: last (weeks, weekends, months, years,festivals) ... Iast weekend ... ... Last month ... 

 in (months, seasons, years, long periods of time) ... in December ... ... in 1979 ... 

 on (days, special days) ... 011 the 5 th of November 2005 ... ... on my parents' 25 th wedding anniversary ... 

at (specific times, noons, midnights,festivals) ... at noon on my birthday ... ... at Christmas ... 

 during (months, seasons, long festivals, long periods of time) ... during the Tet holiday ... ... during the spring ... 

---

 You can also use the following words and phrases for unspecific times: around/about (times, months, occasions, festivals, special days) ... around Christmas ... About my 10 th birthday ... 

 once Once I went on a school trip. I attended a strange party once. 

 one day One day I watched a football match with my cousin. One day I took a bus into the countryside.

Language step 3 The Past Continuous & Past Simple and Past Perfect & 

Past Simple for Setting a Scene 

Let's look at the model answer extracts by the three lELTS candidates, Sophia, Mike and Jean. 

 Sophia ... My mother would lie next to me on the bed and read a different story every night. When she was reading, I would often lay my head on her chest and listen to the voices she made for the different characters in the stories ... Mike .. .It was a 5-a-side football competition held when I was worl{jng for my last company, about four years ago ... Jean I'd like to talk about the time that I was late for an exam. It was in my last year at secondary school, when I was taking my final exams ... 

Notice that in the above model answers, the candidates all set a scene of their monologues by using the past continuous and past simple to help them say when the event occurred. 

---

 Past continuous & past simple When using the past continuous and past simple, the shorter past simple action happened during the longer past continuous (was /were + verb-ing) action. Let's look at the two structures of the past continuous and past simple again: (while/when) + was/were + verb-ing + (when) + past verb While/When I was studying at university, I heard an interesting story. I was studying at university when I heard an interesting story. 

 (when) + past verb + (while/when) + was/were + verb-ing I heard an interesting story while/when I was studying at university. When I wrote this letter, I was travelling back to my university. 

 Past perfect & past simple You can also use the past perfect and past simple to set a scene of your monologue. The past perfect (had + past participle) action happened before the past simple action. The two structures of the past perfect and past simple are: had (already) + past participle + past verb I had studied at university for a few months before my teacher told me ... Because I had already performed really well on the school sports day, the headmaster made me attend another competition. 

 past verb + had (already) + past participle My teacher told me something really important after I had studied at university for a few 

. months. The headmaster made me attend another competition because I had already pelformed really well on school sports day.

Language step 1 The Passive Voice for Location or Cause of Events 

 In his model answer, Mike says: ... The competition was organised by a national football association ... When talking about a past event, native speakers will often use the passive voice to say why or where an event occurred in the past. You may remember the passive voice from previous lessons, but remind yourself of its structure: be + past participle (+ by + agent) I was given a present for my 8 th birthday. The party was held in an office. I was told the story by my teacher. The competition was organised by my school. I was tak?11 to the swimming pool by myfather.

The other members of our team were all my colleagues, who either worked in different departments to me or were more senior managers .than I was ... 

Obviously, when you are talking about a past event, you need to say where it happened. To do this well, you need to use prepositions of location correctly. 

 Remind yourself of these prep ositions of location: 

in + an enclosed or larger place ... in my house ... ... in Vietnam ...

 Language step 3 Relationship, Occupation and Group Words Let's have a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Sophia and Mike, use the relationship, occupation and group words in their monologues. 

 Sophia .. .In the story there was a boy who was a shepherd. His job was to look after his fa ther's sheep in the fields outside his village, but he found it very boring to be by himself all day ... Mike ... The other members of our team were all my colleagues, who either worked in different departments to me or were more senior managers than I was ... Our main concern though was our goal/?teper, Mark, who was absolutely awful! ... 

 Most past events native speakers talk about involve other people as in the above. model answers. You should similarly use relationship, occupation and group words to describe the people involved. We've already looked at some words of relatives, occupations and social positions (Person Monologue Stage 1, Language Step 1). The following table contains a few of these words to remind you, as well as words to describe groups of people. 

 grandparents aunt uncle 

 accountant waiter /waitress musician 

 friend of a friend. next-door neighbour colleague 

 a crowd of people loads people a big group of'people (sport) supporters party-goers a tour group audience guests passengers players 

You can also use the following structure to introduce and describe the people in your past event monologue (for more information about relative clauses, see Person Monologue Stage 1, Language Step 2). 

 person + relative clause Susan, who was an accountant with HSBC, was waiting for me outside. My grandfather, who was a very k.ind and gentle man, got so angry that he ... All of the party-goers who had been dancing all night decided to go to another bar.

Language step 1 Direct & Indirect Speech 

In her model answer, Sophia says: .. .In the story there was a boy who was a shepherd ... He ran into the village shouting "Wolf! Wolf! rhere's a wolf l{jlling my sheep!" ... 

 There are two ways to report what somebody has said: direct speech and indirect speech. 

Direct speech 

The above example is direct speech as Sophia uses quotation marks to say what another person said. (Obviously quotation marks can't be heard by the examiner during the IELTS test, but you can still use this way to report speech.) 

 Other examples are: She always says: "Wear more clothes; don't catch a cold." He said: "I really don't like this party." I said: "I will not go home now." 

This is probably the easiest way to report what somebody has said because you do not need to change the language used. 

---

 Part Two 

Indirect speech 

When you do not use quotation marks and instead use what the person has said as part of your own sentence, this is indirect speech. When using indirect speech, you usually have to change the pronouns, time markers and the tenses of all verbs in the sentence. 

The tense should go back one tense further into the past, so that present simple becomes past simple, past simple becomes past perfect, etc. 

 Examples: She said: "I love you." She said that she loved him. I said: "I have never loved you." I said that I bad never loved her. 

When reporting questions, yes / no questions should be changed using if, while questions that use question words such as how, who, why, etc. should be included in the indirect speech. 

 Examples: I asked her: "Will you go?" I asked her ifshe would go. She asked him: "Why don't you love me?" She asked him wh.y he didn't love her. 

 Look at the following examples: 

 My mother said: "I won't have time to read you a story.". Our teacher said: "Stay together so you won't get lost." She said: "John was hungry yesterday." 

 He said: will go to New York tomorrow." She asked him: "Do you like ice cream?" The teacher asked: "Why didn't you come to class today?" 

 My mother said that she wouldn't have time to read me a story. Our teacher told us to stay together so that we wouldn't get lost. She said that John had been hungry the day before. He said that Mary would go to New York the next day. She asked him if he liked ice cream. The teacher asked me why I hadn't gone to class that day.

I(jJ Exercise 24.8: Rephrasing 

 Rewrite the following sentences, changing them from direct to indirect speech. 

1. He said: "I'm Vietnamese." 

2. She said: "I'm not going to study next year.." 

3. He asked me: "Can you come to my house tonight?" 

4. She told him: "1 don't love you anymore." 

5. 1 said: "1 won't be able to leave the party now." 

6. My dad said: "1 went to Ha Noi many years ago." 

7. 1 asked Jack: "Where is Jill?" 

8. 1 said to my parents: "1 can't tell you as it's a secret." 

9. He said: "1 have never been to Ba Dinh Square." 

 Language step 2 The Past Simple with Sequence Markers Let's see ,how the two IELTS candidates, Sophia and Jean, use the past simple with sequence markers. 

 Sophia .. .In the story there was a boy who was a shepherd ... He ran into the village shouting "Wolf! Wolf! There's a wolf killing my sheep!" Immediately, all the villagers stopped working and ran to the field to help protect the sheep. When they found there was no wolf, the boy laughed at them ... Jean .. .I remember studying by myself in my bedroom and feeling exhausted. I'm not really sure what happened next', but I must have fallen asleep when I was studying because the next thing I krzew it was the next day and the sunlight was streaming through the window. Straight away, I started panicking as itfe ft very late. Looking at my watch, Ifound that I was already 20 minutes late for my exam! So without showering or changing my clothes, I ran out of the house and caught the bus to schooL ..

 Part Two 

 When describing a past event, you need to use the past simple accurately. You should also use sequence markers to structure your monologue this makes it clear what order things happened in and also makes you sound much more like a native speaker. Look at the following useful sequence markers: to start with at the beginning at first as soon as immediately straight away by the time that then so afterwards following that following on from that after (that) next soon after / afterwards shortly after / afterwards in the end finally Examples: 10 start with I felt very nervous, but after a few dances I relaxed and in the end had a really great time. As soon as we entered the stadium we realised we were very early. I watched a documentary about wild animals a few years ago. Following that, I decided not to eat meat anymore because I think it's cruel.

 Language step 3 The Past Continuous & Past Simple and Past Perfect & Past Simple with Adverbs of Surprise Let's have a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Sophia and Jean, use adverbs of surprise in their monologues. 

 Sophia ... Again, the boy ran into the village shouting "Wolf! Wolf! There's a wolf killing .my sheep!" But to his surprise nobody believed him and all his sheep got killed ... Jean ... I'm not really sure what happened next, but I must have fallen asleep when I studying because the next thing J knew it was the next day and the sunlight was streaming through the window ... 

Notice that both Sophia andJean use adverbs of surprise in their monologues. These are very frequently used by native speakers when they talk about past events or stories as they add interest and drama. Look at the following highly useful adverbs of surprise: suddenly all of a sudden 

---

 to (one's) surprise out of the blue surprisingly unexpectedly unbelievably incredibly the next thing I knew 

 Part Two 

 These phrases are commonly used in combination with the past continuous and past simple or past pelfect and past simple as in the examples below: with past continuous & past simple We were quietly wallu'ng along the road when suddenly a car crashed right in front of us. I was sleeping in my parents' car on the way to the airport and then. the next thing J k./1ew we were flying in an aeroplane! We were watching the basketball match on TV when the electricity unexpectedly stopped. W!Jen we were learn ing the first conditional, the activity our English teacher made us do was sUl'prisilJgly enjoyable and useful. 

 with past perfect & past simple I had just sat down in the restaurant when all of a sudden a woman came to my table and threw a glass of wine over me! My girlfriend had told me that there was a problem with our flat, and me to come home quickly. incredibly, when I got home Ifound all my friends and family were there to give me a surprise birthday party! I had prepared for the presentation for a very long time and although I was nervous, it went unbelievably well. My classmates and I hadn't prepared well for the exam and so were really worried. Out of the blue, our teacher told us it was cancelled -it was such a relief! We had our parents for a pet dog many, many times and they always said no. Then one day, to our surprise they said yes! 

IdJ Exercise 24.10: Matching

 Model answers Read the model answers from the three IELTS candidates, Sophia, Mike andJean. 

 Language step 1 Adjectives for Describing Events & Adjectives of Feeling Let's see how the two IELTS candidates, Mike and Jean, use certain adjectives in their monologues. 

 Mike .. .I was really pleased with my performance. Besides, it was a really fun day for all of us. I've always liked playing football, but that was probably the most enjoyable football competition I've ever taken part in. Jean ... Needless to say, this was a pretty horrible experience for me to go through. Apart from feeling so anxious on the day of the exam, I was also worried sick.. about what my result wasgeing to qe for weeks afterwards ... 

As you can see in Mike's and Jean's model answers, you should use adjectives for describing events in your monologue. 

 Here are some more adjectives for you to use: 

 funny amusing'" 

 Strange unusual bizarre 

 Surprising amazing'" astounding'" 

 inspiring'" life-changing 

 Bad : horrible terrible 

 , 

---

 Part Two 

 Interesting Strange interesting· weird fascinating' mysterious curious peculiar stimulating· random thought-provoking crazy enlightening' wild 

 Surprising astonishing· awe-inspiring' incredible breathtaking 

 Good enjoyable wonderful fun refreshing· encouraging' movingliO 

. Bad awful depressing· unpleasant frustrating· disappointing· embarrassing· 

 In addition to describing what the past event was like, you should also talk about how you felt. This makes your monologue more interesting to the examiner and explains why this event was important to you. Let's look at some useful native speaker adjectives offeeling : embarrassed irate incredulous moved pleased delighted thrilled over the moon enthusiastic reassured satisfied 

 Here are some examples using both kinds of adjectives: I felt extremely satisfied to see my paper be published in the school newspaper. Although it was embarrassing at the time, when I think about it now I guess it's pretty amusing. I was really moved to visit a place with such an awe-inspiring history. 

IdJ Exercise 24.11: Table Completion 

 The above adjectives for describing events that are marked with 11 can all be changed into adjectives of feeling. Complete the following table by changing the adjectives for describing events into adjectives of feeling.

 '; Adjectives of Feeling

Have you noticed the pattern for changing adjectives for describing event s into adjectives offeeling? Think of some more adjectives that can describe events and feeling s and write them in the above table. 

Language step 2 The Third Conditional & Present Perfect to Express the 

Importance of an Event 

Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Mike and Jean, stress the importance of a past event in their monologues. 

 Mike .. .I've always liked playing football, but that was probably the most enjoyable football competition I've ever part in ... Jean ... This event taught me the importance of not being late I've always been punctual ever since! 

In your monologue about a past event , you should also tell the examiner what you learned from it or how it has affected your life. This is a great way of saying why the event was important. 

 To do this, you can use either the third conditional or the present perfect. 

---

 Part Two 

 The third conditional We've already looked at the third conditional in previous lessons, but just remind yourself of its structure before looking at some examples below. If + had(n't) + past participle, would(n't) have + past participle If I hadn't pa.rticipated in the speaking competition, I wouldn't have had the confidence to continue studying Italian. 

 would(n't) have + past participle + if + had(n't) + past participle I probably wouldn't have chosen architecture for my major if our school hadn 't us to St. Paul's Cathedral in London. 

 The present perfect to express the importance of an event To talk about the importance of a past event, you can use the present perfect in the following ways: (event) was + the superlative (type of event) I have ever + past participle That ma.tcb was the best match I have ever played in. This stOlY was the most memorable tale I have ever heard. 

 since (event) I have (adverb offrequency) + past participle Since I saw that TV programme, I have often thought about all the animals that become extinct every year. Since that party I have been much more interested in foreign cultures and customs.

1. Introduce and give your opinions clearly. 

2. Support your opinions vvith reasons or examples.

 Part Three 

 Let's look at the model answers from the two IELTS candidates, Sophia and Mike. 

 Interviewer Do you think that children should wear a uniform to school? Sophia Yes, I think that children in middle,school and high school should wear a uniform to school. I strongly believe that it is essential for giving children a sense of identity and unitjJ. Young children can be very snobbish aboutfashion and often ridicule and Pick., on children who don't wear expensive or designer clothes ... Interviewer Do you believe that children can learn ,a lot from team sports? Mike Yes, I do. Children need to learn to work., in groups and co-operate as well as build leadersbip skills. Sport is also good for children to learn to be competitive in a mature manner. It's also very that children ktep fit and healthy. For example, it's been proven that children who learn to play team sports grow up to be more understanding and co-operative adults. 

 Giving and Supporting Opinions is a basic skill you'll need for any type of IELTS Part III answer. You should use this skill in every one of your Part III lessons and consider it as a basic requirement for all native speaker discussions. Notice how Sophia and Mike both follow their introduction of opinion with reasons and examples. Sophia says that she believes that children in middle school and high school should wear a school uniform because: .. .it is essential for giving children a sense of identity and unity. ... children can be very snobbish about fashion and often ridicule and pick on children who don't wear expensive or designer clothes. 

 When asked whether university students should wear a uniform, Sophia says that she thinks they certainly should not and gives her reason: We are all adults ... we should have the freedom to choose what we want to wear ... 

- Remember to state your opinion and then give a reason or example to back it up. It's a simple formula: opinion reasons / examples

I strongly believe that it is essential for giving children a sense of and unity ... Interviewer What about in university? Should university students all wear a uniform? Sophia Certainly not! We are all adults by the time we get to university, so I believe that we should have the freedom to choose what we want to wear and when we want to wear it ... Interviewer Do you think that young people should do more sport in schools today? Mike 

 Interviewer Mike 

 I certainly do. I think,that young people today are getting quite lazy and this is bad for their health. I'm convinced that schools put too much emphasis on academic subjects, so I firmly believe that good sports classes and sports facilities are very important. Do you believe that children can learn a lot from team sports? Yes, J do. Children need to learn to work in groups and co-operate as well as build leadership skills ... 

 Notice how Sophia and Mike both use native speaker expressions to introduce their opinions.

Language step 2 Transitional Words & Phrases 

Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Sophia and Mike, use transitional words and phrases in their responses. 

 Sophia .. .However, there are many people that don't share the same opinion. While some say the television is better, more visual and more modern, others feel the radio has a certain charm, and is more soothing and relaxing. It also depends on the Jifestyle of the individual ... Mike ... However, some people ... make a concerted effort not to eat meat for ethical reasons ... Althougb some scientists say it is important to eat meat for health reasons, others claim that if you eat the right vegetables and fruits, eating meat is not necessary to maintain a good standard of health. 

When talking about different types of people and the opinions they have, you should use transitional words and phrases to link your ideas together. 

 Here are some of the most useful transitional words and phrases: 

while 

 Some people believe that city life is stressful, while others find the buzz and energy of living in a city exciting. 

yet Some people are of the opinion that computer games can help children learn certain skills, yet other people think that they are just a waste of time. 

however People who believe in animal rights think that we should not wear leather shoes or animal skin clothes. However, people who think that we are superior to animals believe we have the right to use them as we wish. 

although 

 Although some people hold the opinion that war is wrong, others believe that there are sometimes good reasons why countries should go to war. Some believe that there are sometimes good reasons why countries should go to war although others hold the opinion that war is wrong.

The formula 

To agree and disagree, you should: 

Language steps 

1. Use agreement expressions.     I wholeheartedly agree! I couldn't agree more! J totally agree with you! 

---

2. Use total and partial disagreement expressions.     J can agree with you to a point, but ... 1 can see your point, but ... J can agree to some extent, but have JIOU considered ... 

3. Use cause and effect logic to support your opinion.     I can't possibly agree because ifwe do X, then Y might happen.     I'm sorry but I absolutely disagree. Tjpeople continue to do X, then it could be very bad        for society.

 Interviewer Some people say that one's university years are the happiest time in life. Would you agree? Sophia Yes, I couldn't agree more! ... 

 Notice how Sophia expresses total agreement with the examiner's question by saying Yes, I couldn't agree more! This is a very native speaker way to say that you agree 100% with the 

. other person. 

 Look at this list of similar agreement expressions: Yes, I agree wholeheartedly. I completely agree. Sure, I too believe that's true / the case. Yes, I share the same opinion.

 Part Three 

 Now look at these agreement expressions in the context of IELTS Speaking tests. Notice how the student not only expresses his agreement, but continues to elaborate on the point and gives reasons to support his agreement: 

 Interviewer Well, some people would argue that the best stage in life is after retirement because life is relaxed and predictable. Donald Yes) 1 totally agree. After a person has retired, they have gone through the challenges of their life and can finally sit back and watch life with a more relaxed attitude. Interviewer Many say that parents should give their sons and daughters the freedom to choose their own majors. Do you agree? Donald Yes) I agree wholeheartedly on that point. Too many parents think they know best'what their sons and daughters should choose to study in university. This means many young people study subjects they don't like, so they don't study with passion or enthusiasm. 

IdJ Exercise 27.1: Gap Fill 

 Write the agreement words and phrases below in the correct spaces.

1. A: Today a lot of people feel that smoking should be banned in all public places. Do you     agree? B: I wholeheartedly that smoking should, indeed, be prohibited in public. It's not fair that non-smokers should have to breathe in toxic smoke. 

2. A: Do you agree that children should wear school uniforms?     B: I more! Children should wear uniforms not only so that they are all "equal"        when at school but also for safety purposes. 

3. A: Do you agree or disagree with the view that everyone should get a university education?     B: Sure, I. A university education is beneficial for anyone, regardless of their        ability or background. 

4. A: Many people say that historic buildings should be carefully preserved and protected. Do     you agree? B: Yes, I that view. Historic buildings are vital for allowing us to remember our own history and culture; they remind us who we really are.

 Language step 2 Total & Partial Disagreement Expressions Let's take a look at how the IELTS candidate Mike uses various total and partial disagreement expressions. 

 nterviewer Many believe that famous people should not be used in advertisements to sell products. Do you agree? No, 1 can't agree with that ... 1 tel'viewer 1 see your poi11t, but some people would disagree and say that advertising companies are using his public image as a famous star as a way to convince people in society to buy their product. Is that not unethical? Mike OK, b1:lt it seems to me that many people, especially younger people, are very vulnerable, particularly in today's fast-paced competitive society, and big companies are taking advantage of them to make money from them ... 

Partial disagreement If you don't agree with what the interviewer says, it's polite to say that you can understand the other person's opinion but you don't agree with it. 

 Look at this list of partial disagreement expressions: I can see your point, but ... I can see what you're saying, but ... I agree up to a point, but... I understand what you're saying, but I don't really agree because ... OK, but have you considered ... Some may hold that opinion, but I'm afraid I disagree because ... 

Now look at these partial disagreement expressions in the context of IELTS Speaking tests. Again, notice how the student not only expresses his disagreement, but continues to elaborate on the point and gives reasons to support his disagreement: 

 Int rviewer Some parents do not accept that their sons and daughters, when in university, go to bars and nightclubs on weekends. Do you agree? Donald Ermmm ... 1 can agree to a point, but I do believe that many parents here are too strict and too traditional. Whilst young people should respect their parents to a certain point, parents should also understand that life is different now to when they were young. Interviewer But, many people would argue that young people are not responsible enough for themselves, so they need their parents to stop them from getting into danger or into trouble.

# l 

 Donald I can see what you're saying; but I don't totally agree. I think that when we're in university, we have reached an age where we should be able to make decisions for ourselves.. 

 Total disagreement It's also very useful to be able to express total or strong disagreement when you want to be assertive without, however, sounding rude. When you do this, it's even more important to give good reasons why you do not agree. Look at these total disagreement expressions: I absolutely disagree because ... I'm sorry, but I can't agree with that because ... I can't possibly agree with that because ... I can't share your opinion on this issue, to be honest, because ... 

 Now look at these total disagreement expressions in the context of IELTS Speaking tests. Again, notice how the student not only expresses his disagreement, but continues to elaborate on the point and gives reasons to support his disagreement: 

 ntel'viewer Do you agree that humans 'should not be allowed to eat animals? Donald I can't possibly agree with that because humans need to eat meat, at least occasionally, to stay healthy. If we don't eat meat, we don't grow up so fast or strong and we will frequently be under the weather and suffer from minor complaints like colds and coughs. Interviewer But many scientists say that's not true, humans can be equally healthy if they have a completely vegetarian diet. Donald I absolutely disagree because I have had a few vegetarian friends over the years and they haven't been as healthy as my meat-eating friends.

6. Interviewer: Do you agree that health care should be provided free to everybody?

 Part Three 

 Language step 3 Cause & Effect Logic As you have noticed in Language Steps 1 and 2, it is vitally important that, whatever your opinion, you support your point with reasons and say why you think that way. Native English speakers often use the logic of cause and effect to support their opinions. This means that you say what will or what would happen under the circumstances being proposed. For example, we shouldn't just say The rainforests should all be protected as this is not a very strong argument. It would be much better to say: The rainforests should all be protected because otherwise global warming will get much worse and many animal species will be killed. This is a much more and convincing statement. Look at a few more examples of cause and effect logic supporting opinions: 

 I can't agree with that because if we don't take care of the natural environment, then we'll regret it in the future. I completely agree that sports players' salaries because sports are ruine.d when there is too much money should be reduced involved and teams start to resemble businesses. I absolutely disagree with you for if we don't invest in alternative energy, the pollution will reach a dangerous level. I can't possibly agree that we should give children more holidays 

 as it will have a detrimental effect on their studies. 

 I agree with you to a point since I think it is unfair that some people can't go to university just because they can't afford it, but then again the country can't pay for everyone to go as we'd run out of money! I really don't agree that women should always because today women also have the right to earn stay home and look after the children money for the family.

Extra language point Rhetorical Qyestions 

Let's see how the IELTS candidate Mike use the rhetorical questions. 

 Mike No, I can't agree with that. I firmly believe that everyone, whether they are famous or not, has the freedom to advertise what they want. Just because Jackie Chan is a celebrity) why should tbis stop him adverh'sing a deodorant or a of camera? 

Sometimes, native speakers will use a rhetorical question, usually at the end of their statement, to, express disagreement. A rhetorical question is a question form, but does not actually require the other person to answer. It is used as a challenge or for persuasive effect when we are disagreeing. 

In the model answer extract above, notice how Mike makes his point, then ends with the question: Just because Jackie Cban is a celebrity) why should this stop him advertising a deodorant or a of camera? Mike is actually saying: Just because Jackie Chan is a celebrity, it doesn't mean he should not advertise things. 

Look at the examples of rhetorical questions and what they actually mean in the table below. 

 Do you really think that it is fair to stop children playing computer games? How can anyone possibly suggest old age is the best time in life? 

 ' Meaning , ' I don't think it is fair at all that people stop children playing computer games. Old age is undoubtedly not the best time in lifel

When talking about disadvantages or drawbacks, it's good to use a range of adjectives to help explain what these are. 

 dull / boring not user-friendly outdated unfair tiring / exhausting overly-complicated old-fashioned overly-restrictive time-consuming unattractive a little ridiculous oppressive difficult fragile unhealthy narrow-minded repetitive impractical environmentally unfriendly tliscriminatory I poorly-paid poorly-made anti-social vague unstable overpriced annoying a little harsh counterproductive low-quality a bit sexist unjust 

 Examples: The disadvantage of the new subway system is the cards -they are all disposable and made of plastic and therefore this is quite environmentally urifriendly. The drawback of going to the gym is that it's quite exhausting after you've done a long day's work. The bad thing about the legal system there is that sometimes the laws are very oppressive. 

Language step 3 Transitional Words & Phrases 

Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Sophia and Mike, use transitional words and phrases in their responses. 

 Sophia ... A lot of work-from-home jobs are part-time or offer a few hours' work per day, rather tban standard jobs that pay a fixed amount every month. So, they are not as secure and stable as most other jobs. Mil e ... people keep fit and healthy and strong as well as being outside in the air. On the other hand, it can be awful to work outside because you may have t'o work in terrible weather conditions like rain, snow and extreme cold ... 

Sometimes the interviewer will ask you about the advantages and disadvantages at the same time. You should try to show that there are good points and bad points, weighing them up with a transitional word or phrase. 

 Look at the following transitional words and phrases: although however while 

---

 yet at the same time while at the same time having said that then again on the one hand ... on the other hand Examples: The main disadvantage of eating in restaurants is that it's expensive although it can be exciting and fun to eat out every now and again. A great thing about computers is that you can buy a computer now that was state-of-the-art only a few months ago quite cheaply. rhen again, this means that the computer you buy now will soon be outdated. The telephone is incredibly useful, while at the same time it can be quite annoying when you want to be left alone. Being into fashion can be a really good thing, yet at tbe same time it can sometimes be a bit silly if people spend too much time thinking about fashion. Going to see sports games can be fun and exciting and exhilarating. Having said that, it can be annoying to be in a crowded stadium with lots of people. On the one hand contact sports are a great way to exercise, but on the other hand they can be quite dangerous.

Formula 29 

Expressing Importance and Priority 

Aims 

 In this lesson you'll master the Formula for Expressing Importance and Priority. What are the most important things to bear in mind if you are planning an overseas trip? Which subjects, sports, activities or lessons do you believe to have the highest priority in a child's education? What environmental concerns today should be addressed most urgently? 

The formula 

To express importance and priority, you should: 

Language steps 

1. Use native speaker importance phrases and adverbs of degree to introduce your     opinion.        Yes, computers playa big role in our lives.           Indeed, this is an important issue for our country today.           I think economics is especially important in today's society. 

2. Use comparatives and superlatives to say why one thing is more important than     another.        Personality is more important than physical appearance.        It's more valuable to teach children maths than art. 

3. Use expressions to say why something is important.     Gymnastics is essential for maintaining a supple body.     Reading is crucial for developing good vocabulary.

 Language step 1 Importance Phrases & Adverbs of Degree Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Sophia and Mike, use the importance phrases and adverbs of degree. 

 Sophia ... As a general rule, I think that academic subjects are the most important part of a child's education ... Having said that, I do feel that sporting activities should playa role in a child's school education ... Learning about art and participating in drama activities ... are alsofairry important for helping young people develop more creative skills as well as learning to express themselves ... Mike Well, that's quite a controversial issue at the momenLprotecting the natural environment and reducing air and water pollution are incredibly important if a country is to progress, develop and maintain a healthy population ... 

 Importance phrases When you are asked how important something is, it's best to begin by using an importance phrase as in the following: X should playa role X plays a big role in our lives X is an important part of our lives X is a controversial issue I question X is an important issue I question X is a top priority Examples: Yes, computers jJ/ay a big role il1 our lives. I think it's an important issue today. Entertainment has always been an important part of OLir lives. Friendship is something we should always velY seriously. Being responsible at work is a top priority in life. 

Adverbs of degree When you begin to talk about how important or valuable something is, it's good to use a variety of native speaker adverbs of degree as in the following phrases: 

 to some extent...important important up to a point quite important fairly important very important especially important particularly important

Firstly, you must take off your shoes; secondly you must remove your hat; and thirdly you mustn't take photos. E .... and learn some basic words like "please" and "thank you" in that language. 

 Extra language point 1 Time Buying Expressions & Backtracking Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Sophia and Mike, use certain expressions to gain time and how they reconsider as well as adjust their previous opinions. 

 Sophia That's a tough question because so much depends on the individual pupil... Having said that, I do feel that sporting activities should playa role in a child's school education ... Mike Well, that's quite a controversial issue at the moment. It's hard to say, whilst environmental concerns are indeed important, this question poses a bit of a dilemma to most governments ... Now that J tbin/tabout it, in the short term I believe that economic development is more important than environmental concerns because this enables a country to become strong enough to address environmental issues in the long term ... 

 Time buying expressions Notice how Sophia and Mike use native speaker time buying expressions in introducing their answers. Buying time is a useful skill because it can give you a few more valuable seconds while you think about what your opinion is and how to express it. 

. So, if the question the interviewer asks is something which is a little controversial, or subject to different opinions, you can "buy yourself some time" with: 

316 

 That's a tough question ... Mmm, that's an interesting point ... Let me think for a second ... Let me see ... I have to say that ... It's hard to say ... Actually ... 

---

 In fact... You see ... Well ... 

 Backtracking 

 Pali Three 

Sometimes, native speakers will think back at what they have just said, and change their opinion slightly or add an extra, slightly contrasting point. It's completely acceptable to do this, you won't lose points for backtracking because natives do it all the time! You can backtrack with: Having said that. .. Now that I think about it, I guess ... Come to think of it... 

 Language step 2 Comparatives & Superlatives Let's see how the two IELTS candidates, Sophia and Mike, use comparatives and superlatives. 

 Sophia ... As a general rule, I think that academic subjects are the most important part of a child's education .. .! feel that team sports are certainly more valuable than individual sports in a child's education. Learning about art and participating in drama activities, though not as importa.nt as academic pursuits and sports .... although I feel academic studies and learning teamwork through sports are more importa.nt, learning about art and drama should not be neglected. Mike .. .in the short term I believe that economic development is more importa.nt than environmental concerns because this enables a country to become strong enough to address environmental issues in the long term. On e a country is richer and more developed, it should then put greater emphasis upon protecting the environment. 

Comparing importance or priority 

When you are discussing how important something is or how high a priority something should be given, most native speakers will use the following comparative structures: 

X is more convenient than Y because ... I am convinced that watching DVDs is much more conven.ient than watching films in the cinema because ... 

X should have Ihas a higher priority than Y because ... I believe science should have a higher than art in schools because ... 

---

 X is more important than Y because ... I hold the opinion that keeping healthy is more important than just hanging out with friends and having fun because ... 

 X is undoubtedly of greater importance than Y because ... I feel that quality education is undoubtedly of greater importance than economic development because ... 

 X is certainly in need of more attention than Y because ... For me, slowing down global warming is certainly in need of more attention than saving particular species of animals because ... 

 X should take precedence over Y because ... Spending money improving our hospitals should precedence over spending money renovating historic buildings because ... 

 Another way of expressing that one thing is more important than another is by saying:, Before doing X, we should do Y. Before spending more money on education, we should 1:1) to raise the standard of living of the countryside population. 

 If the two things you are comparing have the same importance or priority, you can use: X is equally as important as Y because ... Developing the economy is equally as important as saving the environment because ... 

 Superlatives It's also useful to use the superlative as Sophia did in the beginning of her answer: As a general rule, I think that academic subjects are the most important part of a child's education. The way I see it, looking after the ordinary people is the highest priority of the state.

8. Everyone would agree that when you give gifts, giving a home-made gift from the heart is

Language step 3 Expressions to Say Why Something Is Important 

Let's have a look at how the IELTS candidate Sophia explains why something is important. 

 Sophia ... Having'said that, I do feel that sporting activities should playa role in a child's school education, not only because this promotes good health, but also because learning to work in a team is considerably important ... Learning about art and participating in drama activities ... are also fairly importantJor helping young people develop more creative skills as well as learning to express themselves ...

Language step 1 Present Conditions & Future Outcomes Phrases 

 Let's have a look at this part of Sophia's response. 

 Sophia .. .1 think that given the current rate of development, Vietnam will be a verJI strong and modern in quite a sbort time. At the moment the cities are becoming more and more modern, people are constructing more and more office blocks, and traditional residential areas are disappearing at an alarming rate. Taking all these facts into consideration, J have 110 doubt that Vietnam will be a safer, cleaner and more beautiful and convenient place to live in the future ... A lot of scientists are suggesting that due to global warming, it is very that we willface serious problems in the next 30 years ... 

 Notice that in talking about future predictions, Sophia describes what the presentconditions are, and what future outcomes these may lead to. Let's look at these similar structures native speakers use: Given the + noun/noun phrase + future prediction Taking into consideration / account + noun / noun phrase future prediction 

 Look at the following examples in the table and see how each of the parts of the sentence fits together. 

 Opener NOlin/NOlin Phrase Given the current situation in a few years. Taking into consideration the problems we are facing I think we will have to take drastic measures to change things. Taking into account the amazing technological I am sure we Will be living on other advances this century planets in a shott time. 

 Or you can use these structures: Given that + clause + future prediction ConSidering that + clause + future prediction Since + clause + future prediction

 Part Three 

 Again, look at some examples of these structures in the table below: 

 Given that they are making so much effort I am sure 'they will clean up the city before all the tourists come. Considering that they have been working so hard I have no doubt they will all get the scholarships. Since , they are currently putting more money I think that in 10 years most of the into education schools will be very modem. 

IdJ Exercise 31.1: Gap Fill & Matching 

 Write the phrases below in the correct spaces, and then match the sentence halves 1-5 with the sentence halves A-E.

2. the state of the economy in the Middle East ... 

3. Given that __ 

4. Given that the authorities on restoring old buildings ... 

5. Since they 

 A. .. .I think we will see a great improvement in working conditions in the next few years. B ... .I am sure there will be less poverty in the world by 2020. C. .. .I think it will be in trouble after about 50 years and everyone stops using oil. D ... .I believe the future for our country will be a bright one. E. ...I believe that we will have an even greater tourist industry in the coming few years. 

 Language step 2 The Future Perfect & Time Phrases Let's have a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Sophia and Mike, use future perfect tense and time phrases. 

 Sophia ... They say that by theyear 2030 , the ice caps will have melted and we will be paying the price for the damage we did to the environment ... Mike .. .I am also convinced that technology will contribute enormously to advances in the medical industry. For example, I think that in about 50 years, we will have found a cure for cancer and other serious diseases. 

---

Like Mike and Sophia, to predict future outcomes you should use the future perfect tense. The future perfect is used to talk about things that will have been completed or finished at or by a certain point in the future. 

 The structure of the future perfect is: will + have + past participle. Examples: I will have eaten my dinner by 5 p.m. We will have solved many environmental problems in ... 

 We can use the future perfect with the following time phrases: in the future in the next few years in about 40 years in the next two decades in a short time in only a couple of years in our lifetime by the year 2055 by 2030 by next century by the time + clause 

Take a look at the following examples, which combine the future perfect and time phrases: 

 They say that by the year 20.30, the ice caps will have melted. Some believe that by the time we are old, mankind will have cut down all the rainforests on earth .. Some scientists say that by the late 2050s, man will have built' cities on the moon. Many believe that in. only afew years, another 200 species of endangered animals will have become extinct. I am pretty sure that in 100years, we will have succeeded in finding a cure for cancer.

 A. in a very short time; will have solved B. in the future; will having solved C. in only a couple of years; will have solve 

4. A lot of medical research has been done in recent years. I think that , scientists     cures for most known diseases. A. in a short time; will have find B. by next century; will have discovered C. in the next few years; will discovered 

5. A lot of my friends believe the world is getting worse and worse, but I don't agree. I think that     in just or two, we the problem of world poverty.     A. our lifetime; will had solved     B. a short time; would have solved     C. a decade; will have solved 

 Language step 3 The Future Continuous Let's see how the IELTS candidate Sophia uses the future continuous tense. 

 Sophia ... They say that by the year 2030, the ice caps will have melted and we will be paying the price for the damage we did to the environment. Some say that we will possibly be living a very different lifestyle and others even suggest we may be living on other planets by then! 

---

Notice how Sophia talks about what things they think people will be doing in the future as continuing future actions, as opposed to finished actions. The future continuous is used to talk about something that we think will happen in the future and will continue to happen for a period of time, rather than a sudden or finished event in the future. 

 The structure of the future continuous is: will + be + verb-ing. Examples: The Vietnamese countryside will be developin.g for many years to come. By 2015 I will be studying in England. 

 We can also use the future continuous with the following time phrases: in the future in the next few years in about 40 years in the next two decades in a short time in only a couple of years in our lifetime by the year by 2030 by next century by the time + clause Examples: I believe that in about 50 years, we will be living on the moon. I think that in about 100 years, we will be driving flying cars like we see in the movies. Some people are convinced that by the 22nd centUlY, humans will be living on the moon. Many are of the opinion that in only a short time, everyone in the world will be using a home computer.

,. Exercise 31.3: Sentence Completion 

 Complete the sentences below by writing the correct future forms of the words in brackets. 

1. Some believe that in a few years, we (pay) the price for the damage we have     inflicted upon the natural environment. 

2. I think that in one or two decades, people (use) mobile phones inserted into     their brains. 3. Because fashion is constantly changing, many people think that in the future, people     (wear) very different clothes than we wear today.

8. I believe that if we continue to invite artists and musicians from all over the world to our     country, everyone (love) art and music. 

 Extra language point Expressing Likelihood with the First Conditional Another extremely useful way of predicting future outcomes is to use the first conditional. Remind yourself of its structure: if + present verb + will + verb Jfwe continue to treat the planet in this way, we will be in serious trouble in the future. If we don't address the current traffic problems soon, we will face serious problems in the near future. 

 To make your predictions sound more like a native speaker, you can use the following types of likelihood expressions in your first conditional sentences. it is likely /quite likely /highly likely Ivery likely / extremely likely it is probable/quite probable/highly probable it is possible/quite possible Examples: Jfwe continue to treat the planet in this way, it is velY that we will be in serious trouble in the future. 

 www,nhantriviet,(om 337 

---

Jfwe don't address the current traffic problems soon, it is highly probable that we will/ace serious problems in the near future. 

 Remember that we can also reverse the first conditional structure. Examples: 

It is extremely likily that people will be a lot more open-minded in the future if our society continues to welcome art and culture from all over the world. It is quite possible that the world will be a really clean and harmonious place in the future if we taki measures to take care of our planet.
