How to Use 31 High-scoring Formulas to Answer the IEL TS Speaking Questions 

## Structure of the Book 

This book can be used [[eithedor]] self-study or as in-class training material. 31 High-scoring Formulas to Answer the IELTS Speaking Questions consists of 3 parts corresponding to the IELTS Speaking test components. Part 1: 20 high-scoring formulas for IELTS Speaking Test Part One Part 2: 4 high-scoring formulas for IELTS Speaking Test Part Two Part 3: 7 high-scoring formulas for IELTS Speaking Test Part Three , Each formula consists of 2 sections: Answer order and Language steps. Answer order shows you "what to say", which indicates the logic of an answer needed for a speaking test question type; and Language steps show you "how to say it", which includes detailed vocabulary and grammar you need to communicate your ideas. 

## Learning Strategies 

It is recommended that you follow the order of content presented in this book, starting with the basic and easier content first to set a firm base for your speaking skill. To maximise your learning results, consider these following steps: 

1. Clearly understand the purposes and content of each chapter. After every chapter, check to     see whether you have achieved what is intended for that chapter. 

2. Master both Answer order and Language steps. Through Answer order, learn how to think     logically like natives to plan your answers; through Language steps, learn the vocabulary and     grammar needed for your answers. 

3. Acquire new vocabulary by doing the vocabulary exercises and using these words into prac-     tical conversation. 

4. Read the model answers and note down how important words and structures are used in     context. 

5. Study the explanation of model examples and practise with extensive exercises for more     accurate expressions and richer answers. 

6. Work through the material with your friends, if possible. You all can ask and answer in turn     to practise the high-scoring formulas.

Native speaker words 

Let's learn some native speaker words which are useful for answering this type of question. These words can also help you understand the model answers on the next page more thoroughly.

 Part One 

Model answers 

Read the model answers from the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David. 

Language step I Prefer 

Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the verb prefer. 

 Alice I prefer cycling to travelling by bus... ] David Generally, I prefer chatting online ... 

Obviously, the first thing you need to tell the examiner for this type of question is whether you prefer X or Y. Prefer can be followed by either verb-ing or to verb. 

Notice in the examples below that prefer + verb-ing can be followed by either to or rather than, but prefer + to verb can only be followed by rather than. 

prefer + verb-ing + to / rather than + verb-ing I prefer cycling to t:akjng the bus. I prefer eating to cookjng. I prefer bal{jn.g cakes at home rather than buying them in shops. I prefer reading a newspaper rather than watching TV. 

prefer + to verb + rather than + verb I prefer to cycle rather than tak§ the bus. I prefer to eat rather than cool?, I pref er to cakes at home rather than bLtV them in shops. I prefer to read a newspaper rather than watch TV. Both these forms are correct, and mean exactly the same. 

---

dJ Exercise 1.1: Error Correction 

 Some of the sentences below are incorrect, some are correct. Identify the incorrect sentences and write the correct sentences in the spaces provided. 

1. I prefer to go to the cinema to watch DVDs at home. 

2. My sister prefers writing letters to write emails. 

3. I prefer to talk with friends on the phone rather than using emails. 

4. I much prefer to live in a town rather than a big city. 

5. My mother prefers shopping at the market more than in supermarkets. 

6. My friends generally prefer to send text messages to talking on the phone. 

 Language step 2 Comparatives Let's look again at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the comparatives. 

 Alice ... Cycling is so much more convenient than taking the bus if you're not travelling too far. Actually, it's often faster to go by bike because you don't get stuck in traffic jams! Cycling is also better for my health than all other means of transport, including buses. David .. .I nearly always find that chatting online can be more sociable as you can speak to more than one person at the same time. Also, chatting online is often much more fun because you can send smileys, photos and even videos! 

 Mter you have told the examiner whether you prefer X or Y, you should compare them, so it's very important to use comparatives correctly. To form the comparative of an adjective, you should: add -er if the adjective is one syllable long. add -ier if the adjective has two syllables and ends in -yo add more before the adjective ifit has two or more syllables. 

---

 Part One 

 Look at the table below to see how these rules work. 

 large fast slow 

 larger fasteI! slower 

 heavy pretty ugly 

 heavier 

. prettier     uglier 

 comfortable more comfortable 'fashionable more fashionable useful more useful 

 When you compare X and Y, you should use one of the following comparative structures: X + be + comparative + than + Y Watching TV is more interesting than listening to the radio. Cars are prettier than buses. X + be + not as + adjective + as + Y Listening to the radio is not as interesting as watching TV. Buses are not as pretty as cars.

Extra language point Discourse Markers 

Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use discourse markers in their answers. 

 Alice ... Cycling is so much more convenient than taking the bus if you're not travelling too far. Actually, it's often faster to go by bike because ... David .. .I nearly always find that chatting online can be more sociable as you can speak to more than one person at the same time. Also, chatting online is often much more fun because ... 

One reason why Alice's and David's answers are so good is that both candidates put extra little words (called discourse markers) into their answers in a very native way. 

Try to use the following words and expressions more often when you speak English, as they will help make you sound more like a native speaker: 

actually lin fact 

Actually and in fact are very often used by native speakers to introduce something that may be surprising or that slightly changes what was being said before. It is actually a lot cheaper to go to that supermarket. 111 fact, public buses are a lot more environmentally friendly than many people think.

 Part One 

 needless to say Needless to say is another way of saying obviously or everybody knows that." without sounding rude or arrogant. I like eating lots of cakes, but needless to say, that will make me fat. He's done very badly in his exams, so needless to say, he won't get into university this year. 

 also/in addition Also and in addition are used to add extra or further information. I'm a very sociable person. I prefer team sports such as basketball and football and in addition, I like going to English club with my friends. I prefer cycling rather than driving a car because it helps me keep fit; in addition, it's better for the environment and it's also cheaper! 

 besides Besides at the beginning of a phrase means as well as, whereas at the beginning of a clause it means anyway. Besides watching TV and talking to my friends, I can relax while travelling on the subway. I like riding a bike as it's a very convenient way to travel. Besides, it's cheap and I can't afford a car.

My father's recently become keen, on photography, so he's bought an expensive digital camera and spends a lot of time taking photos of everything. I think the Harry Potter novels are fantastic. I often buy those small magazines with short stories in them and read them on the subway on my way to work. Although I come from England, I only eat spicy food every so often.

 In the second sentence, it refers back to studying English. Use it when you are sure that both you and the person you are speaking to are talking about the same thing. Remember, if what you were talking about before was plural, you must say they instead of it. For example: I like watching football matches -they are so exciting.

I'm involved in a reading group at my university and every so often we get together and discuss the latest books we've read over dinner it's so stimu1ating to talk and hear different views about the books we've all read. 

 To explain why you like doing something, you should use adjectives of positive feeling. It is often difficult for non-native speakers to use them correctly, and candidates frequently lose marks in the IELTS test because of this type of mistake. Adjectives of positive feeling come from stative verbs such as satisfy, bore and excite. There are two ways to turn this type of verb into adjectives of positive feeling. Use be + verb-ed when talking about the person who is experiencing the emotion: He is bored when he has nothing to do. She isfascinated by music. They are interested in playing football. I am satisfied with my lessons. The boy is excited when I give him food. Use be + verb-ing when talking about the thing that is causing the emotion: Football is boring. Music isfascinating. Studying English is interesting. Seeing a concert is exciting. Eating a big dinner is satisfying.

 Language step 3 Very Much Let's take a look at how the IELTS candidate David uses very much. 

 David .. .1 don't like my line manager or many of my colleagues very -they're all so boring ... 

 Many students make the terrible mistake of saying the following types of sentences in the IELTS test: I very playing tennis. (X ) I don't liI?g Vel) much going shopping. ( X ) 

---

 Part One 

 This is very bad English and does not sound like a native. 

 Look at the following correct native speaker sentences and see if you can see the correct word order patterns: I like playing tennis very much. I don't like going shopping very much. 

 There are three rules you must remember: You cannot use very before a verb. You cannot use very much before a verb. You can use very much after the activity. Examples: I like reading romantic novels very much. I really like reading romantic novels. I don't like going climbing in the mountains very much. I really don't like going climbing in the mountains. If you want to sound like a native, we advise you to only use very much with short sentences. 

rdJ Exercise 4.3: Error Correction 

 Some of the sentences below are incorrect, some are correct. Identify the incorrect sentences and write the correct sentences in the spaces provided. 

1. I very enjoy studying English.

Read the model answers from the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David. 

Language step I Adverbs of Frequency 

Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use adverbs of frequency. 

 Alice I used to go out to dinner with my friends all the time, but I'm in my last year of university now and I'm really busy .•. David To be honest, I' m reading books; I'm a complete bookworm! I usually rea:d novels, but sometimes (mix it up slightly and read books about history @r nature ...

8. A I B watch TV C. (all the time) 

9. A he B listens to the radio C. (seldom) 

 Language step 2 Adverbs of Infrequency Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use certain adverbs to describe things they rarely do. 

 Alice .. .1 don't often have the chance to. take a break and spend time with my friends. Once in a blue moon I'll have someone over for coffee, or I'll go to a friend's house and hang out ... David ... From tim.e to time I might read some poetry, but I have to be in the right mood. 

 When you do not do the activity the examiner asks you about frequently, you should use a varied range of adverbs of infrequency. 

 Colloquial expressions In addition to never, seldom and rarely (see Language step 1), you can also use the following colloquial expressions to sound more like a native: every once in a while (=sometimes) I play football on Sunday morning every once in a while. 

from time to time (= occasionally) I have friends overfrom time to time. once in a blue moon (=rarely) I drink alcohol once in a blue moon. hardly ever (=almost never) I hardly ever play video games.

Model answers 

Read the model answers from the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David. 

Language step 1 Expressing Degrees of Like 

Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, express degrees oflike. 

 Alice What I particularly like about student life is the golden opportunity it gives me to expand my horizons ... David ... But what I especially value about Nha Trang's location is the fresh seafood we can eat all year round. 

As you can see, Alice and David use different ways to express how much they like different aspects of X. Let's look at some more native speaker ways to express degrees of like: 

 Examples: 

 really especially particularly 

 like enjoy love 

 I really enjoy watching the trees by the lake bend in the wind. I particularly liI& my hometowl1'sfood. I especially love attending my Psychology lectures. 

 verb-ing noun 

Any of the above combinations are fine, and using some varied language will make you sound more like a native speaker. 

---

 Notice that like, love and enjoy can be followed by either a verb-ing or a noun; for examples: I especially like/enjoy/love wall{ing in the countryside. I especially like/enjoy/love the countryside. You cannot say: I like/enjoy/love to wall(j17.g. 

IdJ Exercise 6.1: Error Correction 

 Some of the sentences below are incorrect, some are correct. Identify the incorrect sentences and write the correct sentences in the spaces provided. 

1. I really liking meeting new people. 

2. I particularly to love travelling as part of my job. 

3. She especially enjoys visit the famous sights in my hometown. 

4. I enjoy to taking photographs and sending postcards home.

so 

 Alice ... At university, I can not only increase my knowledge about my major and learn new things like Salsa and yoga, but I can also meet lots of new people. David ... Although we get the odd typhoon every year because we are by the seaside, we also enjoy light sea breezes during the summer ... 

 http://www.nhantriviet.com 

---

 Part One 

 Parallel structure means making sure that the series of words in a sentence are in agreement or in line with each other. The best way to understand this is by looking at some examples: I really enjoy watching plays, writing papers and listening to the school band. My mother particularly likes to dance, go out to restaurants and spend time with the family. As you will notice, all of the verbs in the above sentences have the same form, and so can be said to agree with each other. Many students lose points in the IELTS test because of simple agreement errors such as the following: I especially like reading scientific journals, have fun with my study mates and relaxing on campus. (X) I like to read scientific journals, ha.vejun with my study mates and relaxing on campus. (X) 

IdJ Exercise 6.2: Multiple Choice

Language step 3 Linking Words 

Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use linking words. 

 Alice ... At university, I can not only increase my knowledge about my major and learn new things like Salsa and yoga, but I can also meet lots of new people. David ... Although we get the' odd typhoon every year because we are by the seaside, we also enjoy light sea breezes during the summer. But what I especially value about Nha Trang's location is the fresh seafood we can eat all year round. 

To sound like a native and to improve your score on your speaking test, it's good to show slight comparison, contrast and consequence between ideas and feelings using transitional or linking words. 

 Take a look at the following linking words, and how they are used: but I really like my maths teacher, but I like my science teacher more. 

however My major is history; however, I find art class more exciting. 

although Although I study hard most of the time, I always find time for fun on the weekends. I always find time for fun on the weekends, although I study hard most of the time.

 Model answers Read the model answers from the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David. 

 Language step 1 Types of People Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, describe different types of people. 

 Alice ... Generally speaking, I would say that the majority of high school and university male students regularly play football. As for watching football, I think most Vietnamese men of all ages frequently watch English Premier League matches .. .! don't believe football is very popular with many Vietnamese women. David ... As a rule, the younger generation usually listens to pop, rock or hip-hop music, whereas the older people tend to listen to older Vietnamese songs or folk music. I think many wealthy people listen to classical music, sometimes going to live concerts. 

Notice that both Alice and David say what types of people X is popular with. Talking about types of people is a great way to sound like a native speaker when answering Is X popular (in your country)? type questions. Remember: A country is made up of different types of people, different groups. These different groups have different interests and likes and dislikes. So, don't just speak for the whole nation and say: People in my country like to drink tea. 

---

 Part One 

 A native speaker will talk about the types of people that X is popular with, rather than saying that all people like it. So, a better answer that does not generalise -would be: In general, a lot of elderly Vietnamese people like drinking tea, though there are some who do not like tea. 

 Now let's look at some more words talking about the different types of people that make up a society: 

 I • the older generation the elderly younger people school kids the younger generation adolescents 

- I 

IdJ Exercise 7.1: Matching 

- I retired people office workers white-collar workers unemployed people housewives job seekers 

 poor people rich people the working classes the middle classes the upper classes the lower classes 

 Match the words on the left with the words on the right that have a similar meaning. 

1. elderly people A. the unemployed 

2. office workers B. wealthy people 

3. the lower classes C. adolescents 

4. teenagers D. the older generation 

5. the upper classes E. poor people 

6. job seekers F. white-collar workers 

IdJ Exercise 7.2: Gap Fill 

 Write the words below in the correct spaces. 

1. Traditional Vietnamese activities such as playing Chinese chess and drinking tea are still     very popular with in Vietnam. 

2. Bikes are not as popular as they were a few years ago. Now, bikes are mostly ridden by poor     people (such as ) and at school and college. 

3. The bus is mainly popular with students and travelling to and from work; most     tend to have their own cars and take taxis everywhere.

 Language step 2 Qyantity Words Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the quantity words. 

 Alice ... Generally speaking, I would say that the majority oJhigh school and university male students regularly play football...I think most Vietnamese men of all ages frequently watch English Premier League matches .. .! don't believe football is very popular with many Vietnamese women. David ... Most people in Vietnam listen to music every day .. .! think many wealthy people listen to dassical music, sometimes going to live concerts. 

- 

 Again, you will have noticed that both David and Alice use quantity words in their answers so that they do not generalise. 

 Look at the following quantity words which you should master so that you also don't generalise about people: most I think most people like to occasionally watch and play sports. 

 the majority of ?'he majority oJteenagers listen to pop music at least once a week. a lot of I believe a. lot oj people will decide to study abroad in the future. (not) many Not marry elderly people are interested in basketball. a small percentage of Only a small percenta.ge aJstudents have their own cars. very few In my opinion, very Jew poor people have the chance to study English. 

IdJ Exercise 7.3: Rephrasing 

 Rephrase the sentences below using the words in brackets. 

1. All Vietnamese people regularly play badminton when they are young. (a lot of) 

2. No women play golf in Vietnam. (not many)

4. Nobody at my university play table tennis. (very few) 

5. Everyone watched the Thang Long-Ha Noi 1,OOO-year Anniversary Celebration. (most) 

6. No rich people ever ride a bike. (a small percentage of) 

Language step 3 Expressions of Habit 

Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use expressions of habit. 

 Alice ... Genera1ly speaJ?jng, I would say that the majority of high school and university male students regularly play football ... David .. .As a rule, the younger generation usually listens to pop, rock or hip-hop music, whereas the older people ten.d to listen to older Vietnamese songs or folk music ... 

When you are trying to talk about a lot of people, you should also use different expressions of habit so that you don't generalise too much. 

 Look at the following expressions to say what people usually or normally do: 

in general 

 In general, people in India like to eat spicy food. 

generally speaking Generally speak,jng, English people don't really learn many other languages. 

as a rule 

 This expression simply means generally, and has nothing to do with rules. As a rule, the older generation tends to be more traditional than the younger generation. 

more often than not Businessmen drive cars to work more often than not. 

tend to Most people in my country tend to enjoy playing chess.

 Many companies have a bonus scheme to reward staff that work hard. This obviously provides an incentive for the staff to do a good job. I've never been good at rock climbing; I think it's because my arms aren't strong enough. I absolutely love hiking; it's great to walk through green fields, meadows, up hills and through valleys. My little nephew Daniel is really into aeroplanes; he's always running around the house with a toy aeroplane in his hand and making engine noises. A few years ago, my sister broke her leg when she tried sledging -the hill she went down was far too big. 

 Although snowboarding is really fashionable, I'm too frightened of hurting myself to try it. 

 My favourite time of the year is the depth of winter. Then, there's usually lots of snow, people are on holiday from work and I can enjoy sitting in front of the fire with a good book.

Language step 1 Superlatives 

Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the superlative forms. 

 Alice I think the best time of year to do outdoor activities is either in the summer or in the winter ... The weather between June and early September provides the best conditions for rock climbing, hiking, mountain biking or playing sports like tennis ... David I think the best time of day to study is in the very early morning, just after dawn. This is the quietest time of day .. .It's definitely tbe most productive time of day for me, I just find it difficult to get up so early!

5. The time when people give presents the most is certainly Christmas. 

6. However, in Vietnam, I think most people give gifts or presents people's birthdays. 

 Language step 3 Colloquial Expressions for Advantageous Conditions Let's look at how the IELTS candidate Alice uses colloquial expressions for advantageous conditions. 

 [' Alice ... The b.et:veen J une provides the best conditions for L rock chmbmg, hlkmg, mountam biking or playmg sports ... 

 There are many ways to explain the idea that something is the best or the most suitable. We've already looked at superlatives as one way of doing this, but now let's look at some alternative native speaker expressions for this. good / great for The cold weather isgoodfor making ice sculptures. Evenings at home are ISreatfor relaxing and listening to music. ideal for Spring in Beijing is idealfor hiking along the Great Wall. The day before a big national holiday is idealfor throwing a party. provide the perfect conditions for The combination of mountains and lakes near my hometown provides thepelfect conditions for camping in the summer.

 Extra language point Depend on Let's take a look at how the lELTS candidate Alice uses the verb phrase depend on. 

 Alice I think the best time of year to do outdoor activities is either in the summer or in,] the winter because it depends on what activities you would like to do ... 

 When answering What's the best time (of year) to do X? type questions, it would be easy to say things such as Winter in my country is always relaxing or The morning is the best time of day to study. However, such statements are not always true because situations change according to different circumstances and according to people's preferences. The verb phrase depend on helps us qualify what we say. 

Depend on can be used with nouns. 

 The availability of train tickets during the Tet holiday depends on the amount of people travelling. The best time to do exercise depends on people's lifestyles. Or depend on can be used with gerunds (the -ing form of the verb). Finding a good job depends on having good qualifications. Being happy doesn't necessarily depend on being very rich. 

 You should practise using this verb phrase. You will sound more like a native English speaker and be able to give more accurate answers if you can use it well.

 Language step 2 The Past Simple Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the past simple tense. 

 Alice The last time I went on holiday was about three years ago .. .in July 2008. My family and I went to Sa Pa for two weeks during the summer holiday ... my family and I drove out to the mountains there and in the Fansipan ... David The last time visitors came to my house was just last week. It was my wife's birth· day, and so I secretly arranged fo'r a few close friends to over for dinner and drinks. Although it was difficult to keep my wife from finding out, it was quite exciting in a way and certainly a bit of a challenge! In the end, everything went to plan and we all had a great time it was definitely a really enjoyable evening. 

A lot of students, especially when they are nervous in speaking tests, forget to get their past tenses right, especially for irregular verbs. The only way to get it right is to practise. 

 Look at the table below to remind yourself of the past tense forms of some commonly used irregular verbs:

 Language step 3 Adjectives of Experience Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use adjectives of experience. 

 Alice ... Sa Pa is an intrigu ing place to visit of the Dao minority culture ... David ... Although it was difficult to keep my wife from finding out, it was quite exciting in a way and' certainly a bit of a challenge! In the end, everything went to plan and we all had a great time it was definitely a really enjoyable evening. 

Mter saying when you firstllast did X, and using prepositions and adverbs of time and past simple verbs correctly, you should add a few details to describe what the activity was like. 

 Here are some useful adjectives of experience: difficult, challenging for things you learned to do that were not easy but you enjoyed learning' exciting, thrilling, exhilarating, stimulating, enjoyable -for things that you really enjoyed and that were a lot of fun as well as being interesting fascinating, intriguing, surprising -for things or experiences that were new and you felt very curious about them before/while doing them depressing, upsetting, unpleasant -for things that made you feel sad, very uncomfortable embarrassing, humiliating -for things that made you feel very uncomfortable because other people were watching or because you felt silly irritating, annoying, frustrating -for things that you did not enjoy because you thought they were stupid, a waste of time or far too difficult 

Look at some examples of these words in context: The party I attended was really exciting. I am not used to going to parties with people from lots of different countries, so it wasf ascinating to see how everyone behaved. It was surprising to see so many people having different conversations at the same time! The last time I went on holiday was really depressing, if I am honest. It rained the whole time and my mother got sick. It was upsetting andjrustrating because I don't have much time off work and rarely get holidays. I used a computer for the first time when I was in middle school. I found it really embarrassing because my classmates all knew how to use one but I didn't! 

 Notice that Alice and David don't just say simple sentences such as I found it fun. In the above examples, the candidates use adjectives of experience to describe their experiences in a more interesting way and explain why the experiences felt like that.

2. The first time I visited an art gallery was in 2005. My family all went together, and whilst my     parents were not impressed with modern art, for me it was because it was all so new, and it made me consider things I had never really thought deeply about before. 

3. I last had visitors to my home just a few days ago. They were my and my husband's uni-     versity classmates, and it was great because their conversation is so and their     company is really. We talk about everything and anything and we always have     so much fun. 4, The first time I used a computer was on my 12th birthday, when my uncle gave me a laptop as a present.

Language step 1 The Past Simple & Times in Life Phrases 

Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the past simple and times in life phrases. 

 Alice Yes, I did! .. .It was during the ret holiday. My parents bought me a really wonderful new bike ... David I did not learn to swim at school because my school did not have any swimming classes, but I learned to swimfor afew months one summer when my parents took.. me to classes at the local swimming pool. I went every' other day with a small group of friends ... 

David and Alice use past tenses accurately. The past simple can be used here in two different ways: 

Using the past simple to talk about something that finished in the past: 

 I learned to swim ... I did not learn to swim because ... 

Using the past simple to talk about habitual actions in the past: I went every other day ... I practised playing the guitar three evenings a week ... 

It's important to tell the examiner when you did or did not learn to do X using the following times in life phrases: 

when I was + age When I was lOyears old, my grandfather showed me how to make ... 

on my + birthday On my 8 th birthday, I found out how to ...

 Language step 2 Saying Who Taught You Let's have a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, mention the person who taught them to do something. 

I Alice .. .l was taught to ride by my uncle ... 

l David ... We were taught by ... a semi-professional swimmer. 

 Notice how Alice and David use the simple structure I was taught (to do X) by + the person to say who taught them and some information about them. This is a simple language step, but it's important you get it right. 

 Look at these other examples: [ was taught to knit by my auntie ... I was taught to ride a motorbike by my uncle'sfriend ... [ was taught to cook by my grandmother ... 1 was taught to write by myja.ther ... [ was taught to play football by an elder boy who lived in my street ... 

 You can also use I learned (how) to do X from + the person to say who taught you. I learned (how) to play the violinfrom Mr. Cbevins, my teacher. [ learned (how) to sprintfrom my bestfriend, Ben Johnson. I can use spreadsheets well. [learned (how) to Lise themfrom my dad. I love to make short films with a video camera. [learned (how) to use itfrom myfriend, Yorick. 

 Language step 3 Non-defining Relative Clauses and Adjectives of Personality Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use non-defining relative clauses and adjectives of personality. 

 Alice .. .I was taught to ride by my uncle, who was incredibly encouraging but quite strict... David ... We were taught by a really friend(y and supportive man, who was a semi-professional swimmer. 

Notice how after naming the person who taught them, Alice and David go on to say what their personality was like. 

---

 Look at the following useful adjectives of personality: caring supportive encouraging kind understanding talented firm patient/ impatient strict aggressive 

 Part One 

 These adjectives of personality can also be combined with non-defining relative clauses. A non-defining relative clause provides extra information about the person you are talking about, and takes the form who + extra information (for more about relative clauses, see Part Two, Person Monologue Stage 1). There are two ways to use non-defining relative clauses: part of sentence, non -defining relative clause, part of sentence My mother, who was afantastic coolt, taught me how to make bread. sentence, non-defining relative clause I was taught to make bread by my mother, who was afantastic cook, 

 Look at these other examples of sentences combining adjectives of personality and nondefining relative clauses: I was taught by my brother, who was very impatient. I was taught by a neighbour, who was particularly kind and u.nderstanding. When I was young, my friend Daniel, who was firm butfair, taught me how to play tennis. I learned to play cricket from Mr. Philips, who was quite an aggressive and quic/ttempered teacher. 

dJ Exercise 11.2: Error Correction & Matching 

 Each of the sentences 1-5 has one mistake. Identify and correct the mistakes, then match the sentences to their counterparts A-E.

A. ... who was a friendly, creative woman. 

 B ... .I got to grips with them pretty fast, because I'm quite good at anything related to mathematics. 

C. ... They were both very patient and kind. 

 D .... who was an excellent calligrapher and an understanding, encouraging teacher. 

E ... .It took a while to get the hang of, but it was an interesting way to learn. 

Extra language point Phrases to Express Freedom & Constraints 

It's good to use expressions to say why you did or did not learn to do things in your life. Look at these examples and think how you could use such phrases yourself: 

I was lucky because my parents gave me the chance to + activity. 

I was very fortunate that I had the opportunity to + activity. It's a shame I did not have enough time to + activity. It's unfortunate I could not do + activity, because my parents couldn't afford it. I wish I had had more ambition ana patience when I was younger, then I might have learned to do + activity.

 Language step 1 The Present Perfect Let's look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the present perfect tense. 

 Alice I'm from Ho Chi Minh City and it bas certainly changed a lot in recent years. Not so long ago, there were lots more low-rise buildings and narrow streets; now the local government has replaced them with tall apartment buildings ... They have also put a lot more parks in the city and have planted thousands of trees ... David ... Restaurants and eateries have changed a great deal since I was young; .. 

 Notice that Alice and David use the present perfect accurately to talk about changes that have happened. Remember that the structure of the present perfect is: have / has + past participle She has invested lots of money in a KTV bar. The government has spent lots of money on public transport recently. The traffic situation bas become a lot worse in the last few years. 

IdJ Exercise 12.1: Sentence Completion 

 Complete the sentences below by writing the present perfect forms of the verbs in brackets. 

1. In recent years, people (cut) down a lot of trees in the Brazilian jungle. 

2. Cleaner streets, nicer buildings and better transport     this city in the past couple of years. 

 (bring) a lot of tourists to 

3. This week, the authorities ____ (fight) to restore law and order to the city with great     success. 

4. My university campus (undergo) a lot of changes in the past few years. 

5. My parents (spend) a considerable amount of money fitting a new kitchen and     bathroom in our home. 

6. In recent years, fashion (become) much more interesting and stylish.

 Language step 2 The Past Simple & Present Simple Let's look at how the two lELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the past simple and present simple tenses. 

 Alice ... Not so long ago, there were lots more low-rise buildings and narrow streets ... The streets are now much wider than before ... the city is more beautiful. David ... Restaurants and eateries have changed a great deal since I was young. When I was a kid, nearly all restaurants in our city were cheap ... Now, however, a wide range of Vietnamese and many international restaurants line every street. These are a lot cleaner and more elegant than the small eateries ... 

 Alice and David use the past simple and present simple accurately to talk about changes. This may seem like a very simple language point, but many students get a low score on the test for making basic mistakes with these tenses. Look at some example sentences that use these tenses to talk about changes: My town was small; now it is quite big. The streets used to be very quiet; now they are noisy. The shops sold poor-quality clothes; now they sell the latest designer fashions. Before many people ate at small eateries or night markets, but now people choose more expensive restaurants. 

ldJ Exercise 12.2: Sentence Completion 

 Complete the sentences below by writing the correct forms of the verbs (the present simple or past simple) in brackets. 

1. When I was a child, everyone in my area of town had to shower in communal bathrooms in     the street. Now, however, most people (be) wealthy enough to have their own,     modern bathrooms. 

2. Before, many people (go) to small shops or markets to buy groceries. In recent     years, big supermarkets have become very popular. 

3. In the past, the suburbs (not look) very attractive. Now, because the govern-     ment has planted lots of trees and plants, the area (look) very pleasant. 

4. In the past, it _ _ _ (cost) a lot of money to buy aeroplane tickets, but recently prices     have gone down and air travel is more 'accessible to everyone.

Language step 3 Comparative Adjectives 

Let's take a look at how the two IELTS candidates, Alice and David, use the comparative adjectives. 

 Alice ... now the local government has replaced them with tall apartment buildings with better facilities ... The streets are now much wider than before. They have also put a lot more parks in the city and have planted thousands of trees in the streets, so the city is more beautiful. David ... These are a lot cleaner and more elegan.t than the small eateries, but sadly are more impersonal and much more expensive! 

Notice how Alice and David use a lot of comparatives to explain how their cities have changed and to express whether those changes are good or bad. 

 This is a very important part of your answer, so now let's review comparatives. 

Comparative adjectives 

 We add -er at the end of the adjective, or we add more before the adjective. To form the comparative of an adjective, you should: add -er if the adjective is one syllable long. add -ier if the adjective is two syllables long and ends in -yo add more before the adjective if it is two or more syllables long. 

 Look at the table to refresh your memory. 

 cheap cheaper easy easier expensive more expensive large larger heavy heavier comfortable more comfortable fast faster pretty prettier fashionable more fashionable slow slower ugly uglier useful more useful 

Comparative structure 

 In comparing the past to the present, it is also useful to remember this structure: 

X + is/are + comparative adjective + than + time in the past My city is prettier than it was ten years ago. The university library is much better stocked now than it was before. The city is a lot greener tball it was when I was a child.

David My university campus is quite scruffy and run-down. I suggc t t:he authorities im prove it by spending more money on up-keeping the grounds and moderni ing the classrooms ... 

Notice how both Alice and David start by identifying the problem, then go on to use the structure improve X + by + verb-ing/ make X + comparative + by + verb-ing to talk about changes they would make or they suggest others make. 

For changes you would make 

would improve X + by + verb-ing / would make X + comparative + by + verb-ing I would improve my bedroom by putting posters on the walls. I would mal?f my living room cosier by buying a new sofa. I would improve my flat by getting a new wardrobe.

 Alice .. .I would have the windows made bigger and lighter curtains made andfitted ... David .. .IfI were in authority, I would have new classrooms built, I would have the sports fadli ties repaired ... 

 Notice how Alice and David use the structure would have + something + past participle to talk about what they would get others to do. First look at the difference between the active (what you would do) and the passive (what you would get others to do): 

 100 

 I would the windows bigger. = I would do it myself. I would have the windows made bigger. = I would get someone else to come and do it for me.

For native speakers, it's not very good to make absolute statements like All people like ... or Everyone in Western countries thinks ... This doesn't sound very clever and can sometimes be rude. Even in one country or one culture, many people have different ways of life and different opinions. 

You should use expressions for quantities of people and types of people to qualify your statements so that they are not so generalised. 

 You can use these expressions for quantities of people: most the majority of a large percentage of nearly all a vast amount of few hardly any not many a minority of only some 

You can combine them with the expressions for types of people to say which people in society usually do something or believe something. 

 young people / the younger generation / teenagers / adolescents old people / the elderly / the older generation office workers/business people/white-collar workers the working classes / middle classes / very wealthy people unemployed people/the poor/homeless people young kids/ schoolchildren/ university students/ graduate students
